    This program allows you to simulate keyboard and mouse input by pressing a shortcut.
    It let's you also execute a command.

    You can use this to automate things on your computer

    Unfortunately Wayland does not allow simulating input. To solve this problem, <a href="https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool">ydotool</a> is used, which creates a virtual input device.
    <b>This requires root permission</b>.

    While jdMacroPlayer is designed with Wayland in mind, it also works on X11
