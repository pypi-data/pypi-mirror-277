|project| no longer crashes when received EOF or when channel is not explicitly
closed -- by :user:`pbrezina`.

Previously, |project| crashed if ``channel.recv`` was called and ``libssh``
returned ``SSH_EOF`` error. It also crashed on some special occasions where
channel was not explicitly closed and the session object was garbage-collected
first.
