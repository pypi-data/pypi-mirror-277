Added separate changelog fragment types for contributor-
and downstream-facing patches -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

Their corresponding identifiers are ``contrib`` and ``packaging``
respectively. They are meant to be used for more accurate
classification, where one would resort to using ``misc`` otherwise.
