:pep:`660` is now enabled -- :user:`webknjaz`.

Previously, due to restrictive :pep:`517` hook reimports,
our in-tree build backend was losing :pep:`non-PEP 517 <517>`
hooks implemented in newer versions of ``setuptools`` but not
the earlier ones. This is now addressed by reexporting
everything that ``setuptools`` exposes with a wildcard.
