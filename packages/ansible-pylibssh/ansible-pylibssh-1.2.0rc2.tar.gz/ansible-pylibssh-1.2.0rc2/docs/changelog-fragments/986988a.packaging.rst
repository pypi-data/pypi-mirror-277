From now on, the published distribution package artifacts
for the new releases are signed via `Sigstore
<https://sigstore.dev>`__ -- by :user:`webknjaz.`

This is happening as a part of the GitHub Actions CI/CD
workflow automation and the signatures are uploaded to
the corresponding GitHub Release pages.
