Backtest trading strategies with Python.

Kudos to ***Zach LÃ»ster*** for the original project [`kernc/backtesting.py`](https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py) 
which he built and maintained for 5 years. 

We at [LUCIT](https://www.lucit.tech) like to use `backtesting.py` with our customers in smaller projects. 
Unfortunately the project is missing important updates and therefore we decided to fork the project and release new 
stable versions. 

We are happy to maintain the forked repository and take care of code reviews, pull requests and releases and hope for 
good support from the community!

Installation
------------

    $ pip install lucit-backtesting


Usage
-----
```
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover

from backtesting.test import SMA, GOOG


class SmaCross(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        price = self.data.Close
        self.ma1 = self.I(SMA, price, 10)
        self.ma2 = self.I(SMA, price, 20)

    def next(self):
        if crossover(self.ma1, self.ma2):
            self.buy()
        elif crossover(self.ma2, self.ma1):
            self.sell()


bt = Backtest(GOOG, SmaCross, commission=.002,
              exclusive_orders=True)
stats = bt.run()
bt.plot()
```
