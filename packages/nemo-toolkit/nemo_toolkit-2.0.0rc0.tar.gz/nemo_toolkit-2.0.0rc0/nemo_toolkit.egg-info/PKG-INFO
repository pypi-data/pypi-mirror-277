NeMo (**Ne**ural **Mo**dules) is a toolkit for creating AI applications built around **neural modules**, conceptual blocks of neural networks that take *typed* inputs and produce *typed* outputs.

**NeMo Core** provides common APIs all modules and models have to implement.

**NeMo Collections**

* ASR - collection of modules and models for building speech recognition networks
* TTS - collection of modules and models for building speech synthesis networks
* NLP - collection of modules and models for building NLP networks
* Vision - collection of modules and models for building computer vision networks
* Multimodal - collection of modules and models for building multimodal networks
