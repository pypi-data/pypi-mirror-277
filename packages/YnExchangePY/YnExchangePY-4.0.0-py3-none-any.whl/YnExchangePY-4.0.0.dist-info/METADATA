# Installation

```bash

pip install YnExchangePY

```

# Functionality

The library provides functions for retrieving the price of 15 cryptocurrencies. Each function takes two arguments:<br/>

* currency (str): This argument specifies the desired currency (either "IRT" or "USD").

* grouping (bool, optional): This argument is optional (defaults to False). If set to True, the function will format the price with comma separators for readability.<br/><br/>

**Here's a list of all the available functions:**

* ```yn_exchange.TON_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.BTC_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.ETH_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.USDT_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.SHIB_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.BNB_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.DOGE_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.ADA_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.SOL_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.XRP_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.USDC_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.ETC_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.PEPE_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

* ```yn_exchange.ATM_PRICE(currency, grouping=False)```

# Example Usage

```python

from YN_Exchange import yn_exchange



# Get Bitcoin price in USD with comma separators

bitcoin_usd_price = yn_exchange.BTC_PRICE("USD", grouping=True)

print(f"Bitcoin price in USD: ${bitcoin_usd_price}")



# Get Ethereum price in IRT

ethereum_irt_price = yn_exchange.ETH_PRICE("IRT")

print(f"Ethereum price in IRT: {ethereum_irt_price}")

```

# Error Handling

If the function encounters an error, such as an invalid currency or a network issue, it will raise a ```ValueError``` exception. You can handle this exception using a try-except block.

# Limitations

* The library relies on scraping data from a website, which may be subject to changes or become unavailable.

* The library only supports a limited number of cryptocurrencies (currently 15).

# Additional notes
