              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

# **open_retrieval**
![open_retrieval](images/open_rag.jpg)
* A Python package based on langchain that abstracts RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) utilities, providing unified document loaders, embedding models, text splitters, vector databases and retrievers in one package based on open source models.
* No api keys needed

## **BENEFITS**
* Unified Interface: Simplifies complex processes by providing a unified interface for various RAG utilities.
* Flexibility: Supports multiple document sources, splitting methods, embedding providers, vector databases, retrievers, enhancing adaptability to diverse use cases.
* Scalability: Designed to accommodate future functionalities, ensuring long-term viability and relevance.

## **INSTALL AND RUN**
    pip install open_retrieval

### **Document Loaders**
The DocumentLoaders class is used to load documents from different sources and return them as a list of strings. The supported sources include csv files, json files, pdf files , html_files, markdown, word_documents, and powerpoint files.

The purpose of the DocumentLoader class is to provide a single interface for loading documents from various sources and to ensure that the process of loading documents is consistent across different sources. This allows the code that uses the DocumentLoader class to be more flexible and easier to maintain.

By using the DocumentLoader class, the code can be written in a way that is independent of the specific source of the document. This makes it easier to modify or extend the code in the future, as new sources of documents can be added without affecting the rest of the code.

#### Example usage:
    from open_retrieval.document_loaders import DocumentLoader
    loader = DocumentLoader()
    file_path = os.path.join("path/to/file.csv")
    data = loader.load(file_path)
    url = "https://example.com/document.html"
    data = loader.load(url)

### **Text Splitters**
The TextSplitters class is used to split text into a list of document objects. It can be used to preprocess the text data before indexing it to a vector database.

The TextSplitter class provides a number of different splitters, including splitters that split based on  htmlheader, characters, markdownheader, paragraphs(recursive), or tokens. The splitters can be configured with arguments to control the splitting process, such as the maximum length of the chunks or the set of headers to split on and also include extra metadata in the resulting chunks.

The TextSplitter class is designed to be flexible and can be used with a wide range of text data, including HTML documents, Markdown documents, and plain text. It is also designed to be scalable in future.

#### Example usage:
    from open_retrieval.document_loaders import DocumentLoader
    from open_retrieval.text_splitters import TextSplitter
    document_loader = DocumentLoader()
    splitter = TextSplitter(splitter="recursive")

    file_path = os.path.join("path/to/file.csv")
    data = loader.load(file_path)
    documents = splitter.split(data, chunk_size = 800, chunk_overlap=0, extra_metadata=extra_metadata)

### **Embedding Providers**
The EmbeddingProviders class is responsible for providing different embedding functions based on the embedding_provider specified. It initializes the class with the specified embedding_provider and provides the get_embedding_function method to retrieve the embedding function based on the model_name.

At the moment we currently support embedding models from huggingface, fastembed and ollama.

#### Example usage:
    from open_retrieval.document_loaders import DocumentLoader
    from open_retrieval.text_splitters import TextSplitter
    from open_retrieval.embedding_providers import EmbeddingProvider

    loader = DocumentLoader()
    file_path = os.path.join("path/to/file.csv")
    data = loader.load(file_path)
    url = "https://example.com/document.html"
    data = loader.load(url)

    # Split the text
    splitter = TextSplitter(splitter="recursive")
    documents = splitter.split(data, chunk_size = 800, chunk_overlap=0, extra_metadata=extra_metadata)

    # Get the embedding function
    embedding_type = 'huggingface' #fastembed
    embedding_provider = EmbeddingProvider(embedding_provider=embedding_type)
    embedding_function = embedding_provider.get_embedding_function()

#### **Vector Databases**
The purpose of the VectorDatabase class is to manage different vector databases, such aschroma, milvus, qdrant, faiss or array. It provides a consistent interface for creating and managing indexes for different vector databases.

#### Example usage
    from open_retrieval.document_loaders import DocumentLoader
    from open_retrieval.text_splitters import TextSplitter
    from open_retrieval.embedding_providers import EmbeddingProvider
    from open_retrieval.vector_databases import VectorDatabase

    loader = DocumentLoader()
    file_path = os.path.join("path/to/file.csv")
    data = loader.load(file_path)
    url = "https://example.com/document.html"
    data = loader.load(url)

    # Split the text
    splitter = TextSplitter(splitter="recursive")
    all_documents = splitter.split(data, chunk_size = 800, chunk_overlap=0, extra_metadata=extra_metadata)

    # Get the embedding function
    embedding_type = 'huggingface' #fastembed
    embedding_provider = EmbeddingProvider(embedding_provider=embedding_type)
    embedding_function = embedding_provider.get_embedding_function()
    
    # embed the documents
    database = 'chroma' #type of the database
    index_dir = 'tests/index/' #path to the folder where the indexes are stored
    index_name = f"{database}_index_{embedding_provider}" #name of the index
    vector_database = VectorDatabase(vector_store=database)
    vector_database.create_index(embedding_function, documents, index_dir)
    vector_index = vector_database.create_index(embedding_function=embedding_function,docs=all_documents, index_name=index_name,index_dir=index_dir)

### **Retrievers**
The purpose of the Retriever class is to manage different retrival techniques such as naive_retrieval and ranked_retrieval. It provides a consistent interface for creating and managing different retrival techniques
It uses the unified rerankers API by answerdotai : https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/rerankers

#### Example usage
    from open_retrieval.document_loaders import DocumentLoader
    from open_retrieval.text_splitters import TextSplitter
    from open_retrieval.embedding_providers import EmbeddingProvider
    from open_retrieval.vector_databases import VectorDatabase
    from open_retrieval.retrievers import Retriever
    from rerankers import Reranker

    loader = DocumentLoader()
    file_path = os.path.join("path/to/file.csv")
    data = loader.load(file_path)
    url = "https://example.com/document.html"
    data = loader.load(url)

    # Split the text
    splitter = TextSplitter(splitter="recursive")
    all_documents = splitter.split(data, chunk_size = 800, chunk_overlap=0, extra_metadata=extra_metadata)

    # Get the embedding function
    embedding_type = 'huggingface' #fastembed
    embedding_provider = EmbeddingProvider(embedding_provider=embedding_type)
    embedding_function = embedding_provider.get_embedding_function()
    
    # embed the documents
    database = 'chroma' #type of the database
    index_dir = 'tests/index/' #path to the folder where the indexes are stored
    index_name = f"{database}_index_{embedding_provider}" #name of the index
    vector_database = VectorDatabase(vector_store=database)
    vector_database.create_index(embedding_function, documents, index_dir)
    vector_index = vector_database.create_index(embedding_function=embedding_function,docs=all_documents, index_name=index_name,index_dir=index_dir)

    # retrieve top-k contexts
    retrieval_type = 'ranked' #type of retrieval: naive or ranked
    ranking_model = "colbert" #ranking model to choose from
    filter_params = {'file_name': 'who_guidelines'} #filter parameters 
    ranker = Reranker(ranking_model, verbose=0)
    retriever = Retriever(vector_index=vector_index, ranker = ranker)
    results = retriever.ranked_retrieval( query=query, top_k=15, filter = filter_params )
