# A temporary directory is needed to store large data during processing. 
# The path here is the directory which will be created and destroyed as needed
# as the Lezargus temporary directory. An initial temporary file serves as a 
# marker flag that a directory is temporary; the extension is automatic.

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

# To prevent multiple console handlers being created when Lezargus is

# resolution of the perfect field of view is based on the "count", data points 
# across for each axis.
# Note that because we usually assume point sources, the meridional and zonal 
# point count should be odd. Although possible with an even count, a warning
