Summary: GISL is a versatile Python library designed for Geographic Information System (GIS) tasks. It offers methods to retrieve country names and codes, determine continents, geocode IP addresses, calculate distances between coordinates, find time zones, and get addresses from latitude and longitude. GISL also allows users to obtain the public IP address of the current machine, making it an essential toolkit for developers and researchers working with geospatial data.

# GISL (Geographic Information System Library)

GISL is a Python library that provides functionality for various Geographic Information System (GIS) tasks such as retrieving country names, continents, latitude and longitude information, addresses, timezones, and public IP addresses.

## Features

- Retrieve country names and continents based on country codes.
- Obtain latitude and longitude information from IP addresses. \
<strong style="color: #FF5500; font-size: 0.75rem; font-weight: bolder;">Latitude and longitude from IP address is not allways fully reliable</strong>
- Calculate distances between coordinates.
- Determine timezones based on coordinates.
- Reverse geocoding to get address information from coordinates.
- Get the public IP address of the current machine.

## Installation

You can install GISL via pip:
```bash
pip install gisl
```

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use GISL:
```python
from gisl import GISL

gisl = GISL()

country_name = gisl.get_country("US")
print("Country Name:", country_name)
```

Output:
```
Country Name: United States
```
