"""Annotation data module.

This module manages the data of annotations.

To see how this fits among all the modules of this package, see
`tf.browser.ner.annotate` .

Annotation data is either the set of pre-existing data in the corpus or the
result of actions by the user of this tool, whether he uses the TF browser, or the API
in his own programs.

Annotation data must be stored on file, must be read from file,
and must be represented in memory in various ways in order to make the
API functions of the tool efficient.

We have set up the functions in such a way that data is only loaded and
processed if it is needed and out of date.

        This class is also responsible for adding entities to a set and deleting
        entities from them.

        Both addition and deletion is implemented by first figuring out what has to be
        done, and then applying it to the entity data on disk; after that we
        perform a data load from the update file.

            When the tool runs in browser context, each request will create a
            `Data` object from scratch. If no data is provided to the initializer,

            it to the initializer here.

        We try to be lazy. We only load data from disk if the data is not
        already in memory, or the data on disk has been updated since the last load.

        The resulting data is stored in current set under the various keys.

        After processing, the time of processing is recorded, so that it can be
        observed if the processed data is no longer up to date w.r.t. the data as
        loaded from source.

        For each such set we produce several data structures, which we store
        under the following keys:

        *   `dateProcessed`: datetime when the data was last processed
        *   `entityText`: dict, text of entity by entity node or line number in

            feature name and then by text of the entity;
        *   `entitySummary`: dict, list of entity nodes / line numbers, keyed by value
            of entity kind;
        *   `entityIdent`: dict, list of entity nodes./line numbers, keyed by tuple of
            entity feature values (these tuples are identifying for an entity);
        *   `entityFreq`: dict of counters, a counter for each feature name; the
            counter gives the number of times each value of that feature occurs in an
            entity;
        *   `entityIndex`: dict of dict, a dict for each feature name; the sub-dict
            gives for each position the values that entities occupying that position
            can have; positions are tuples of slots;
        *   `entityVal`: dict, keyed by value tuples gives the set of positions
            that entities with that value tuple occupy;
        *   `entitySlotVal`: dict, keyed by positions gives the set of values
            that entities occupying that position can have;
        *   `entitySlotAll`: dict, keyed by single first slots gives the set of
            ending slots that entities starting at that first slot have;
        *   `entitySlotIndex`: dict, keyed by single slot gives list of items
            corresponding to entities that occupy that slot;

            *   if an entity starts there, an entry `[True, -n, values]` is made;
            *   if an entity ends there, an entry `[False, n, values]` is made;
            *   if an entity occupies that slot without starting or ending there,
                an entry `None` is made;

            Above, `n` is the length of the entity in tokens and `values` is the
            tuple of feature values of that entity.

        buckets: iterable of list

        It is a handy function for the TF browser to call, but not so much when you

        Parameters
        ----------
        additions: tuple of tuple or string
            Each member of the tuple corresponds to an entity feature.
            It is either a single value of such a feature, or an iterable
            of such values.
            The tuple together specifies a set of entities whose entity features
            have values that are either equal to the corresponding member of
            `additions` or contained in it.
        buckets: iterable of list
            This is typically the result of
            `tf.browser.ner.annotate.Annotate.filterContent()`.
            The only important thing is that member 2 of each bucket is the list
            of entity matches in that bucket.
            Entities will only be added at these places.
        excludedTokens: set, optional set()
            This is the set of token positions that define the locations that must not
            receive new entities. If the last slot of an entity is in this set,
            no entity will be added there.
