"""Central Annotation object.

As a preparation, read `tf.about.annotate` first, since it explains the concepts, and
guides you to set up the configuration for your corpus.

The main task of this module is to find occurrences of annotations
on the basis of criteria.

But this is just the tip of the iceberg, since this module inherits
from a number of other modules that inherit form yet other modules:

*   `tf.browser.ner.show`: generate HTML for annotated buckets of the corpus;
*   `tf.browser.ner.sets`: manage annotation sets;
*   `tf.browser.ner.data`: manage annotation data: loading, adding/deleting
    annotations;
*   `tf.browser.ner.settings`: manage the specifics of a TF corpus and have
    access to its data.

It also uses

*   `tf.browser.ner.match`: to filter individual buckets on the basis of
    criteria.

Hence, `Annotation` is the central class of this tool, whose methods are relevant
for:

*   `tf.browser.ner.ner`: the API for users to manipulate annotations in their
    own programs, especially in a Jupyter notebook.
*   `tf.browser.ner.web`: Flask app that routes URLs to controller functions.

`web` makes use of the following modules that are not needed by `ner`:

*   `tf.browser.ner.serve`: define the controllers of the web app

Again, this is a top of an iceberg, since it inherits from:

*   `tf.browser.ner.request`: manage the data of a request;
*   `tf.browser.ner.fragments`: generate HTML for widgets on the page;

`request` also uses `form` to retrieve form values into typed and structured values.

Both `web` and `ner` make use of the following modules in as far as they are not
already mentioned under `annotate` and its parent classes:

*   `tf.browser.ner.helpers`: a variety of context-free data jugglers;
*   `tf.browser.html`: a generic library to generate HTML using Pythonic
    syntax.

!!! note "Class hierarchy"
    The classes `Settings`, `Corpus`, `Data`, `Sets`, `Show`, `Annotate`,
    `NER` form one hierarchy.
    So an object of class `NER` has access to all methods of these classes.

    The classes `Serve`, `Request`, `Fragments`, `From` form a separate hierarchy.
    It will create an `Annotate` instance which will be stored in a `Serve` instance.

Here is an overview how the modules hang together.

A `|` denotes inheritance, parent classes above child classes.

A `<-<` arrow denotes dependency by importing code.

        """Entity annotation.

        Basic methods to handle the various aspects of entity annotation.
        These methods can be used by code that runs in the TF browser
        and by code that runs in a Jupyter notebook.

        This class handles data, it does not contain code to generate HTML.
        But it has a parent class, `Show`, that can generate HTML.

        This class works with a fixed annotation set.
        But it has a parent class, `Sets` that has method to manipulate such sets
        and switch between them.

        We consider the corpus as a list of buckets (typically level-3 sectional
        units; in TEI-derived corpora called `chunk`, being generalizations of
        `p` (paragraph) elements). What type exactly the buckets are is configured
        in the `ner/config.yaml` file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app: object
            The object that corresponds to a loaded TF app for a corpus.
        data: object, optional None
            Entity data to start with. If this class is initialized by the browser,
            the browser hands over the in-memory data that the tool needs.
            That way, it can maintain access to the same data between requests.
            If None, no data is handed over, and a fresh data store will be
            created by an ancestor class (Data)
        browse: boolean, optional False
            If True, the object is informed that it is run by the TF
            browser. This will influence how results are reported back.

        Either the buckets of the whole corpus are filtered, or a given subset
        of buckets, or a subset of buckets, namely those contained in a
        particular node, see parameters `node`, and `buckets`.

        **Bucket filtering**

        The parameters `bFind`, `bFindC`, `bFindRe`  specify a regular expression
        search on the texts of the buckets.

        The positions of the found occurrences is included in the result.

        The parameter `anyEnt` is a filter on the presence or absence of entities in
        buckets in general.

        **Entity filtering**

        The parameter `eVals` holds the values of a specific entity to look for.

        **Occurrence filtering**

        The parameter `qTokens` is a sequence of tokens to look for.
        The occurrences that are found, can be filtered further by `valSelect`
        and `freeState`.

        In entity filtering and occurrence filtering, the matching occurrences
        are included in the result.

        Parameters
        ----------
        buckets: set of integer, optional None
            The set of buckets to filter, instead of the whole corpus.
            Works also if the parameter `node` is specified, which also restricts
            the buckets to filter. If both are specified, their effect will be
            combined.
        node: integer, optional None
            Gets the context of the node, typically the intermediate-level section
            in which the node occurs. Then restricts the filtering to the buckets
            contained in the context, instead of the whole corpus.
        bFind: string, optional None
            A search pattern that filters the buckets, before applying the search
            for a token sequence.
        bFindC: string, optional None
            Whether the search is case sensitive or not.
        bFindRe: object, optional None
            A compiled regular expression.
            This function searches on `bFindRe`, but if it is None, it compiles
            `bFind` as regular expression and searches on that. If `bFind` itself
            is not None, of course.
        anyEnt: boolean, optional None
            If True, it wants all buckets that contain at least one already
            marked entity; if False, it wants all buckets that do not contain any
            already marked entity.
        eVals: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of values corresponding with the entity features `eid`
            and `kind`. If given, the function wants buckets that contain at least
            an entity with those properties.
        qTokens: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of tokens whose occurrences in the corpus will be looked up.
        valSelect: dict, optional None
            If present, the keys are the entity features (`eid` and `kind`),
            and the values are iterables of values that are allowed.

            The feature values to filter on.
            The results of searching for `eVals` or `qTokens` are filtered further.
            If a result is also an instance of an already marked entity,
            the properties of that entity will be compared feature by feature with
            the allowed values that `valSelect` specifies for that feature.
        freeState: boolean, optional None
            If True, found occurrences may not intersect with already marked up
            features.
            If False, found occurrences must intersect with already marked up features.
        showStats: boolean, optional None
            Whether to show statistics of the find.
            If None, it only shows gross totals, if False, it shows nothing,
            if True, it shows totals by feature.

        Returns
        -------
        list of tuples
            For each bucket that passes the filter, a tuple with the following
            members is added to the list:

            *   the TF node of the bucket;
            *   tokens: the tokens of the bucket, each token is a tuple consisting
                of the TF slot of the token and its string value;
            *   matches: the match positions of the found occurrences or entity;
            *   positions: the token positions of where the text of the bucket
                starts matching the `bFindRe`;

            If `browse` is True, also some stats are passed next to the list
            of results.
