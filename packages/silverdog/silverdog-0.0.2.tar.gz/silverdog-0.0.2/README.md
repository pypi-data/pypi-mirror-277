# Silverdog

## IMPORTANT
- Test package only
- Won't compile
- Putting some of my ideas in writing to drive future development
- Was built with the intention of serving a future educational program, with that gone this package may never get updated...

## Purpose
- Provide convenient higher-level interfaces for faster devops

## Why
- nogard's brother
- Moves on from the incompentence of COBRA, almost in a backwards fashion

## Future
- Ideally, this database abstract would be good for RISC V's IOMMU, PostgreSQL, In-Memory (Pandas/Polars), and DDP (dataclasses)
