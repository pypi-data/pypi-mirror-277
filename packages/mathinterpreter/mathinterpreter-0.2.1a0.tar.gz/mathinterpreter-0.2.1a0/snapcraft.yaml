summary: An interpreter for evaluating simple math calculations.
description: |
  An interpreter, written from scratch in Python, that can evaluate simple math calculations, 
  with a simple Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) command line interface. 
  This project is based on py-simple-math-interpreter, by David Callanan and illustrates 
  the use of software engineering techniques to evolve a prototype code 
  into a professional software.
