# Python - Math Interpreter

An interpreter, written from scratch in Python, that can evaluate simple math calculations, with a simple Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) command line interface. This project is based on  [py-simple-math-interpreter](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-simple-math-interpreter), by David Callanan and illustrates the use of software engineering techniques to evolve a prototype code into a professional software. 

Since our objective is to create an education/professional example we didn't change the original business logic, *i.e.*, we do not change the interpretor code. Besides the four basic operations ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) we implemented the power operator `^` to calculate `a^b` and the modulo operator `%`.

## How to install and run the REPL


### Using pipx (recommended)

To use this project as a standalone command line tool install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) and run:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/ScientificThought/py-math-interpreter
```

### Install using pip

If you want to install this package and use it as a library on another project you ccan use `pip` and a virtual environment manager.  There are many ways to do that but if you already know how to setup a virtual environment, probably you could proceed your way. 

In our development setup we use `venv`, which comes with python, on Ubuntu Linux. If you are new to software development, follow the steps we recommend below which is expect to work on any Linux Distribution.

Create a new directory and a new virtual environment for working with `mathinterpreter`:

```bash
mkdir mynewproject
cd mynewproject
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
Note that `mynewproject` could be any name of your choice and that instead of using `source` you could simply use the `.` command. After activating your new environment, install the package from source using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ScientificThought/py-math-interpreter.git
```
At this point you can run the REPL, from the directory in which you installed the package by typing `mathinterpreter` in your terminal. This will open the REPL terminal of the interpreter and you can now use it for evaluating math expressions:
```
$ mathinterpreter
calc > 1+1        
2.0
calc > (3.0+2*2)/3
2.3333333333333335
calc > q
$ 
```
Just type `q` or `quit` followed by enter  in the REPL to return to your shell. That's it.

### How to use this package as Python module

You can import the module `mathinterpreter` from your python code and use the function `calc` to evaluate expressions, as in the following:
```python
from mathinterpreter import calc

value = calc('1 + 3*(5*2+1)/2')
print(value)
```
To using `mathinterpreter` as a library you will need to import the Lexer, the Parser, and the Interpreter classes. For understanding how the interpreter works we recommend you to look the files `mathinterpreter/__main__.py` and `mathinterpreter/calculate.py`, which implement the REPL.

## What we have done and what we are doing

### Current implementation includes:**

*Version*: 2024.05.07
- library `mathinterpreter` (Lexer, Parser, Interpreter, and a `calc()`, to simplify calculations);
- a simple command line interface, `mathinterpreter`, using a simple REPL;


### Project Software Stack

- pip: for package installation frontend;
- setuptools: for package installation backend;
- pytest: for unit tests;
- black: for automatic code formatting;
- GitHub Action Scripts: for CI Automation;

### Planned improvements
We track feature requests with issues. But we aim to implement:

- implement code coverage;
- expand the tests suit;
- improve the cli:
    - use `argparse` to improve the cli usage, allowing the user to call `mathinterpreter "1+1"`, for example.    
    - make the REPL more user friendly;
