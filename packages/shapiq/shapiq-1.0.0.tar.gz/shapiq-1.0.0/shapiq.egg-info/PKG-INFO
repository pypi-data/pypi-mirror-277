> An interaction may speak more than a thousand main effects.

Shapley Interaction Quantification (`shapiq`) is a Python package for (1) approximating any-order Shapley interactions, (2) benchmarking game-theoretical algorithms for machine learning, (3) explaining feature interactions of model predictions. `shapiq` extends the well-known [shap](https://github.com/shap/shap) package for both researchers working on game theory in machine learning, as well as the end-users explaining models. SHAP-IQ extends individual Shapley values by quantifying the **synergy** effect between entities (aka **players** in the jargon of game theory) like explanatory features, data points, or weak learners in ensemble models. Synergies between players give a more comprehensive view of machine learning models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Install
`shapiq` is intended to work with **Python 3.9 and above**. Installation can be done via `pip`:

```sh
pip install shapiq
```

## ‚≠ê Quickstart

You can explain a model with `shapiq.explainer` and visualize Shapley interactions with `shapiq.plot`.
If you are interested in the underlying game theoretic algorithms, then check out the `shapiq.approximator` and `shapiq.games` modules.

### üìà Compute any-order feature interactions

Explain your models with Shapley interaction values like the k-SII values:

```python
import shapiq
# load data
X, y = shapiq.load_california_housing(to_numpy=True)
# train a model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)
# set up an explainer with k-SII interaction values up to order 4
explainer = shapiq.TabularExplainer(
    model=model,
    data=X,
    index="k-SII",
    max_order=4
)
# explain the model's prediction for the first sample
interaction_values = explainer.explain(X[0], budget=256)
# analyse interaction values
print(interaction_values)

>> InteractionValues(
>>     index=k-SII, max_order=4, min_order=0, estimated=False,
>>     estimation_budget=256, n_players=8, baseline_value=2.07282292,
>>     Top 10 interactions:
>>         (0,): 1.696969079  # attribution of feature 0
>>         (0, 5): 0.4847876
>>         (0, 1): 0.4494288  # interaction between features 0 & 1
>>         (0, 6): 0.4477677
>>         (1, 5): 0.3750034
>>         (4, 5): 0.3468325
>>         (0, 3, 6): -0.320  # interaction between features 0 & 3 & 6
>>         (2, 3, 6): -0.329
>>         (0, 1, 5): -0.363
>>         (6,): -0.56358890
>> )
```

### üìä Visualize feature interactions

A handy way of visualizing interaction scores up to order 2 are network plots.
You can see an example of such a plot below.
The nodes represent feature **attributions** and the edges represent the **interactions** between features.
The strength and size of the nodes and edges are proportional to the absolute value of attributions and interactions, respectively.

```python
shapiq.network_plot(
    first_order_values=interaction_values.get_n_order_values(1),
    second_order_values=interaction_values.get_n_order_values(2)
)
# or use
interaction_values.plot_network()
```

The pseudo-code above can produce the following plot (here also an image is added):
