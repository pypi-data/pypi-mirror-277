    r"""Plot the distribution of each feature.

    If the input has ``n`` features, this function returns a figure
    with ``n`` histograms: one for each features.

    Args:
        features: The features. It must be a tensor of shape
            ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``.
        feature_names: The feature names. If ``None``,
            the feature names are generated automatically.
        ncols: The number of columns.
        figsize: The individual figure size in pixels.
            The first dimension is the width and the second is the
            height.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for ``plt.hist``.

    Returns:
        ``matplotlib.pyplot.Figure``: The generated figure.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if the ``features`` shape is invalid
        RuntimeError: if ``features`` and ``feature_names`` are not
            consistent

    Example usage:

    ```pycon

    >>> from startorch.plot.matplotlib import hist_feature
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> fig = hist_feature(np.random.rand(10, 5))
