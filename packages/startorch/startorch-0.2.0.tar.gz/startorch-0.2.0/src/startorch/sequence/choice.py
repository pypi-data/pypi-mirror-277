class MultinomialChoiceSequenceGenerator(BaseSequenceGenerator):
    r"""Implement a sequence generator that select a sequence generator
    at each batch.

    This sequence generator is used to generate sequences with different
    generation processes. The user can specify a list of sequence
    generators with an associated weight. The weight is used to sample
    the sequence generator with a multinomial distribution. Higher
    weight means that the sequence generator has a higher probability
    to be selected at each batch. Each dictionary in the
    ``generators`` input should have the following items:

        - a key ``'generator'`` which indicates the sequence generator
            or its configuration.
        - an optional key ``'weight'`` with a float value which
            indicates the weight of the sequence generator.
            If this key is absent, the weight is set to ``1.0``.

    Args:
        sequences: The sequence generators and their weights.
            See above to learn about the expected format.

    Example usage:

    ```pycon

    >>> from startorch.sequence import MultinomialChoice, RandUniform, RandNormal
    >>> generator = MultinomialChoice(
    ...     (
    ...         {"weight": 2.0, "generator": RandUniform()},
    ...         {"weight": 1.0, "generator": RandNormal()},
    ...     )
    ... )
    >>> generator.generate(seq_len=10, batch_size=2)
    tensor([[...]])
