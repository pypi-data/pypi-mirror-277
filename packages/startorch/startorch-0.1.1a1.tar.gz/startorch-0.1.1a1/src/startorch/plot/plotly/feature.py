    If the input has ``n`` features, this function returns a figure
    with ``n`` histograms: one for each feature.

    Args:
        features: The features. It must be a tensor of shape
            ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``.
        feature_names: The feature names. If ``None``,
            the feature names are generated automatically.
        ncols: The number of columns.
        figsize: The individual figure size in pixels.
            The first dimension is the width and the second is the
            height.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for
            ``plotly.graph_objects.Histogram``.

    Returns:
        The generated figure.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if the ``features`` shape is invalid
        RuntimeError: if ``features`` and ``feature_names`` are not
            consistent

    Example usage:

    ```pycon

    >>> from startorch.plot.plotly import hist_feature
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> fig = hist_feature(np.random.rand(10, 5))
