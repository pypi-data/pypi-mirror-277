2. Any commercial use of this Python package is prohibited. The author holds no liability for any misuse of the package.

You can pass several arguments to `FundaScraper()` for customized scraping:
- `area`: Specify the city or specific area you want to look for, e.g. Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam, etc.
- `want_to`: You can choose either `buy` or `rent`, which finds houses either for sale or for rent. 
- `find_past`: Specify whether you want to find the data in the past or the ones in the market. If `True`, only historical data will be scraped. The default is `False`.
- `page_start`: Indicate which page you want to start scraping. The default is `1`. 
- `n_pages`: Indicate how many page you want to scrape. The default is `1`. 
- `min_price`: Indicate the lowest amount for the budget.
