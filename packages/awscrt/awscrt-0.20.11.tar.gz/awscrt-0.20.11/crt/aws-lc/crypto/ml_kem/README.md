# AWS-LC ML-KEM readme file

The source code in this folder implements ML-KEM-ipd as defined in FIPS 203 (Initial Public Draft) Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard ([link](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd)).

NOTE: THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DRAFT VERSION OF FIPS 203, NOT THE FINAL STANDARD. WE WILL CHANGE THIS IMPLEMENTATION TO CONFORM WITH THE STANDARD WHEN IT BECOMES OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC.

**Source code origin and modifications.** The source code was imported from a branch of the official repository of the Crystals-Kyber team that follows the standard draft: https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/tree/standard. The code was taken at [commit](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/11d00ff1f20cfca1f72d819e5a45165c1e0a2816) as of 03/26/2024. At the moment, only the reference C implementation is imported.
