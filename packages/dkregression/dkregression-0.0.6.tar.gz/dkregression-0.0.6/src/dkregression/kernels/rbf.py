class RBF():
    """
    The radial basis function (RBF) kernel or squared exponential kernel, how it sometimes is also referred to uses a bell curve to calculate the relationship between two points $x_1, x_2\in\mathbb{R}^d$ in space. It has one (hyper)parameter: the sacale length $\ell$. Let $\mathbf{x}_1\in\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$ be a matrix that represents $m$ $d$-dimensional points and $\mathbf{x}_2\in\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ be a matrix that represents $n$ $d$-dimensional points, then the RBF kernel is defined as:
    $$
    k(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2)=\exp\left(-\\frac{\lVert\mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1\\rVert_L^2}{2\ell^2}\\right)~.
    $$
    $L$ is the distance norm used. The kernel matrix is of shape $k(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2)\in\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$.

    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Set of data points used to initizalize the kernel. Needs to be two-dimensional of shape `(n,d)` with `n` being the number of points and `d` being the dimenionsionality. This determines the initial guess for the kernel parameter $\ell$ as well as the upper and lower bounds of $\ell$ if the `DKR.fit` method is used.
        dist_norm (float, optional): Order of the norm that is used for calculating the pairwise distance between two points. 
        lower_bound_multiplier (float, optional): Factor by which the inital guess for the kernel parameters should be multiplied to obtain a lower bound for the search conducted in `DKR.fit`. Value should fulfill `0<=lower_bound_multiplier<=1`.
        upper_bound_multiplier (int, optional): Factor by which the inital guess for the kernel parameters should be multiplied to obtain a upper bound for the search conducted in `DKR.fit`. Value should fulfill `1<=upper_bound_multiplier`.
        k_nearest_initial_guess (int, optional): The $k$ used in the heuristic to calculate the average distance between all points in the dataset and their k-nearest point which is used as initial guess for the kernel scale length $\ell$.

    Attributes:
        param_names (list): A list of strings that contains the names of the model parameters. For the RBF kernel, this is the scale length 'l'.
        dist_norm (float): The L distance norm to be used to calculate the pairwise distances in the RBF kernel function. Value needs to fulfill `0<dist_norm`.
        k_nearest_initial_guess (int): The $k$ used in the heuristic to calculate teh average distance between all points in the dataset and their k-nearest point which is used as initial guess for the kernel scale length $\ell$.
        params (dict): Contains the current estimate of the kernel hyperparameter $\ell$. The keys are defined in `RBF.param_names`. For the RBF kernel the only key of this dictionary is 'l'. Upon creating the RBF object, an initial guess for the scale length is calculated as the average distance of the `k_nearest_initial_guess`-th closest point for each point in `X`. This ensures that on average, a sufficient number of points contribute to the kernel regression, at least for the inital guess.
        params_lower_bound (dict): Same keys as defined in `RBF.params_names`, provide the lower bounds for the kernel parameters ($\ell$ for the RBF). The value is determined by multiplying the factor `RBF.lower_bound_multiplier` with the inital guess for each of kernel parameters.
        params_upper_bound (dict): Same keys as defined in `RBF.params_names`, provide the upper bounds for the kernel parameters ($\ell$ for the RBF). The value is determined by multiplying the factor `RBF.upper_bound_multiplier` with the inital guess for each of kernel parameters.
