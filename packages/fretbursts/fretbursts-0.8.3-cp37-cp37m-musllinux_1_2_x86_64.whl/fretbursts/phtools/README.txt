Compile optimized functions
===========================

To compile the optimized function into C with Cython and then to machine code,
enter in the folder with a terminal and type:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Note: Normally the extension is automatically compiled when doing a local
      installation of fretbursts from sources using pip (i.e. "pip install .")
