  abstract  = {This article addresses the error floor reduction of double-binary turbo codes. The proposed approach is an extension of a low complexity method originally proposed for decoding binary turbo codes. This method's interest is that it does not need to modify the turbo coding scheme as long as an error detection code is serially concatenated with the turbo code. Simulation results showed that error rate performance gains can reach one order of magnitude in the cases of the DVB-RCS and DVB-RCS2 standards, while keeping a well-handled computational complexity.},

  abstract = {Decoding turbo codes with the max-log-MAP algorithm is a good compromise between performance and complexity. The decoding quality of the max-log-MAP decoder is improved by using a scaling factor within the extrinsic calculation. Simulations using the 1MT-2000/3GPP parameters demonstrate that this method gives ~0.2 to 0.4 dB performance gain compared to the standard max-log-MAP algorithm},
