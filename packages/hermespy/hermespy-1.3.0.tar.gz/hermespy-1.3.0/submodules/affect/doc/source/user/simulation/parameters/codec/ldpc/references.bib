  abstract = {We introduce a simple erasure recovery algorithm for codes derived from cascades of sparse bipartite graphs and analyze the algorithm by analyzing a corresponding discrete-time random process. As a result, we obtain a simple criterion involving the fractions of nodes of different degrees on both sides of the graph which is necessary and sufficient for the decoding process to finish successfully with high probability. By carefully designing these graphs we can construct for any given rate R and any given real number /spl epsiv/ a family of linear codes of rate R which can be encoded in time proportional to ln(1//spl epsiv/) times their block length n. Furthermore, a codeword can be recovered with high probability from a portion of its entries of length (1+/spl epsiv/)Rn or more. The recovery algorithm also runs in time proportional to n ln(1//spl epsiv/). Our algorithms have been implemented and work well in practice; various implementation issues are discussed.},

They are applied to codes with parity-check matrices generated either randomly or using geometric properties of elements in Galois fields. Both decoding schedules have low computational requirements. The original concurrent decoding schedule has a large storage requirement that is dependent on the total number of edges in the underlying bipartite graph, while a new, staggered decoding schedule which uses an approximation of the belief propagation, has a reduced memory requirement that is dependent only on the number of bits in the block. The performance of these decoding schedules is evaluated through simulations on a magnetic recording channel},

We show that when the Tanner graph of the code is acyclic and connected, the proposed scheme is optimal in the sense of MAP decoding and converges faster (or at least no slower) than the standard BP algorithm. Interestingly, this new version keeps the computational advantages of the forward-backward implementations of BP decoding. Both serial and parallel implementations are considered. We show by simulation that the new schedule offers better performance/complexity trade-offs.},

Professors Ryan and Lin, known for the clarity of their writing, provide the latest information on modern channel codes, including turbo and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. They also present detailed coverage of BCH codes, Reed–Solomon codes, convolutional codes, finite-geometry codes, and product codes, providing a one-stop resource for both classical and modern coding techniques.
The opening chapters begin with basic theory to introduce newcomers to the subject, assuming no prior knowledge in the field of channel coding. Subsequent chapters cover the encoding and decoding of the most widely used codes and extend to advanced topics such as code ensemble performance analyses and algebraic code design. Numerous varied and stimulating end-of-chapter problems, 250 in total,
are also included to test and enhance learning, making this an essential resource for students and practitioners alike.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new bit flipping (BF) decoder, called the probabilistic parallel BF (PPBF) for low-density parity-check codes on the binary symmetric channel. In the PPBF, the flipping operation is performed in a probabilistic manner which is shown to significantly improve the error correction performance. The advantage of the PPBF also comes from the fact that no global computation is required during the decoding process and that all the computations can be executed in the local computing units and in parallel. The PPBF provides a considerable improvement of the operating frequency and complexity, compared to other known BF decoders, while obtaining a significant gain in error correction. An improved version of the PPBF, called non-syndrome PPBF is also introduced, in which the global syndrome check is moved out of the critical path and a new terminating mechanism is proposed. In order to show the superiority of the new decoders in terms of hardware efficiency and decoding throughput, the corresponding hardware architectures are presented inSection II. The application-specific integrated circuit synthesis results confirm that the operating frequency of the proposed decoders is significantly improved, compared to that of the BF decoders in the literature while requiring lower complexity to be efficiently implemented.},
