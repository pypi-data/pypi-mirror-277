  abstract = {In this letter, we propose an adaptive SC (Successive Cancellation)-List decoder for polar codes with CRC. This adaptive SC-List decoder iteratively increases the list size until at least one survival path can pass CRC. Simulation shows that the adaptive SC-List decoder provides significant complexity reduction. We also demonstrate that polar code (2048, 1024) with 24-bit CRC decoded by our proposed adaptive SC-List decoder with very large maximum list size can achieve a frame error rate FER $\leq$ 10\textsuperscript{-3}{-3} at E\textsubscript{b}/N\textsubscript{o} = 1.1dB, which is about 0.25dB from the information theoretic limit at this block length.},

  abstract = {Decoding performance of turbo codes can flatten at moderately high signal-to-noise ratio. This letter proposes a low complexity method for lowering this error floor. This method rests on the observation of the extrinsic information during the iterative decoding process. A set of q most unreliable bits are identified based on their associated extrinsic information. A total of 2\textsuperscript{q} test patterns are then built by inverting the most unreliable bits. The decoded codeword is identified thanks to a cyclic redundancy check detector. This method keeps the turbo coding scheme unchanged as long as an error detection code is serially concatenated with the turbo code. Simulations were performed on a rate-1/3 Long-Term Evolution turbo code and show an improvement of at least one decade in terms of frame error rate in the error floor region. This low complexity method paves the way for further improvements in lowering the error floor of turbo codes.},
