License: # Round Robin Software License 2.0.0
        
        ## Purpose
        
        This license lets you use and share this software for free. You
        can license your applications however you like, but you have
        to contribute changes, additions, and other software that
        builds on this software back on similar terms.
        
        ## Agreement
        
        To receive this license, you have to agree to its rules. Those
        rules are both obligations under that agreement and conditions
        to your license. Don't do anything with this software against
        any rule you can't or won't follow.
        
        ## Notices
        
        Give the text of this license or a link to
        <https://roundrobinlicense.com/2.0.0> to everyone who gets
        a copy of any part of this software from you, along with
        information making clear this license applies to the software.
        
        ## Copyleft
        
        With two exceptions, [Prototypes](#prototypes) and
        [Applications](#applications), contribute all changes and
        additions you make to this software, as well as all software
        that invokes this software's functionality. When in doubt,
        contribute.
        
        ## Prototypes
        
        You don't have to contribute any change, addition, or other
        software that meets all these criteria:
        
        1. You don't use it for more than thirty days.
        
        2. You don't share it outside the team developing it, other
           than for non-production user testing.
        
        3. You don't use it on behalf of anyone outside the team
           developing it.
        
        ## Applications
        
        You don't have to contribute any software that only invokes
        this software's functionality through the interfaces
        this software exposes, unless it exposes so much of this
        software's interfaces or functionality to users, programmers,
        or other software that it becomes a practical substitute
        for this software for any substantial portion of its use
        cases. Interfaces exposed by this software include all the
        interfaces this software provides users, programmers, or other
        software to invoke its functionality, such as command line,
        graphical, application programming, remote procedure call,
        and inter-process communication interfaces.
        
        ## Contribute
        
        To contribute software:
        
        1. Publish all source code for the software in the preferred
           form for making changes through a freely accessible
           distribution system widely used for similar source code,
           so other contributors and users can find and copy it.
        
        2. Make sure every part of the source code is available under
           this license, the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0, or terms with
           substantially the same legal effect. You can include source
           code licensed by others under the MIT License, two-clause
           BSD License, BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License, Apache License
           Version 2.0, or similar terms that give less certainty about
           patents, so long as the developers of the source code don't
           mention that patents apply or might apply to the software
           in code comments, documentation, or legal notices, and you
           aren't aware of any such patents yourself.
        
        3. Take these steps within thirty days.
        
        4. Note that this license doesn't let you change the license
           for this software. Follow [Notices](#notices).
        
        ## Excuse
        
        You're excused for unknowingly breaking [Copyleft](#copyleft)
        if you contribute as required, or stop doing anything
        requiring this license, within thirty days of learning
        you broke the rule. You're excused for unknowingly breaking
        [Notices](#notices) if you take all practical steps to comply
        within thirty days of learning you broke the rule.
        
        ## Copyright
        
        Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
        software that would otherwise infringe their copyright in it.
        
        ## Patent
        
        Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this
        software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they
        can license or become able to license.
        
        ## Reliability
        
        No contributor can revoke this license.
        
        ## No Liability
        
        **_As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,
        without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will
        be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software
        or this license, under any kind of legal claim._**
