Excel input file parameter description
--------------------------------------

The table below displays the input parameters of RAMP. If **NA** is displayed in the table below, it means that the corresponding column is not applicable to the parameter.

When filling an .xlsx input file, you can simply leave the cell empty if the parameter is not mandatory. In this case, the default value will be automatically used.

The **"allowed values"** column provide information about the format one should provide. For example:

- {1,2,3} is a set and the allowed value are either 1, 2 or 3;
- in [0-1440] is a range and the allowed value must lie between 0 and 1440. 0 and 1440 are also possible values.

Python input file parameter description
---------------------------------------

A new instance of class ``User`` requires the parameters ``user_name``,
``num_users``, ``user_preference`` from the table above. To add an
appliance, use the method ``add_appliance`` with at least the mandatory
parameters listed in the table above (except the first three parameters
which belong to the user class and are already assigned in this case)
and with any of the non-mandatory ones.

If no window parameter (``window_j_start``, ``window_j_end``) is
provided to the ``add_appliance`` method of the user, then one must 
call the ``windows`` method of the appliance to provide up to 3 windows
: ``window_1``, ``window_2``, ``window_3`` as well as ``random_var_w``
The parameters to describe a window of time should directly be
provided as a numpy array ( for example
``window_j = np.array([window_j_start, window_j_end])``) (where j is an
integer smaller or equal to the provided value of ``num_windows``).

If no duty cycle parameter is provided to the ``add_appliance`` method
of the user, then one can enable up to 3 different duty cycles by calling 
the method ``specific_cycle_i`` of the appliance (where i is an integer
smaller or equal to the provided value of ``fixed_cycle``) The
parameters to describe the ith duty cycle are the following: ``p_i1``,
``t_i1``, ``p_i2``, ``t_i2``, ``r_ci``, ``cwi1`` and ``cwi2``. It is also
possible to provide the parameters ``cwi1`` and ``cwi2`` using the
method ``cycle_behaviour`` of the appliance.

The legacy way to create an appliance instance is by using the
``Appliance`` method of the user (note that the names of input
parameters are the old ones). This way of creating an appliance is to
keep the backward compatibility of legacy input files: using the
``add_appliance`` method of the user should be preferred. Note that with
the legacy method, one must then call the ``windows`` method of the
appliance to provide at least one windows. And one can add duty cycles
only via the method ``specific_cycle_i`` of the appliance.
