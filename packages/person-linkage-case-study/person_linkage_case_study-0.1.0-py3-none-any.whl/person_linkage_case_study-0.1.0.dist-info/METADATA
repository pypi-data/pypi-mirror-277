# Person linkage case study (for PyPI)

**If you have access to GitHub, we recommend installing from https://github.com/ihmeuw/person_linkage_case_study.**
**This package is provided only for the convenience of users who cannot access GitHub.**

## Getting started

Before you start, you'll need to have Python installed.
If you intend to use Spark, you'll also need Spark **3.4** to be installed
on your system.

First, make a directory to use for development.
Inside this directory, create and enter a virtual environment for this project:

```console
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

and install this package:

```console
$ pip install person_linkage_case_study
```

Your new working directory for interacting with the case study will
be *inside this venv*. Specifically:

```console
$ cd .venv/lib/python3.*/site-packages/person_linkage_case_study
```

To test that things are set up correctly, try running:

```console
$ snakemake --forceall
```

## Installing extras

You can install dependencies for using Spark and Dask by installing with those extras:

```console
$ pip install person_linkage_case_study[spark,dask]
```

## Spark without Singularity

The case study typically runs Spark in a Singularity container. If you cannot use Singularity,
edit the file at `person_linkage_case_study/profiles/default/config.yaml` to say
`use-singularity: false` instead of `use-singularity: true`.
As mentioned above, this will rely on Spark **3.4** being installed on your system.
Specifically, it must be installed at `/opt/spark`.

## What's next?

For further instructions, see the README.md bundled within the package (at the top level
of your working directory as described previously).
Aside from how to use Spark, and installing with `pip install person_linkage_case_study`
instead of `pip install -e .`, all the instructions in that README apply to a PyPI installation.
