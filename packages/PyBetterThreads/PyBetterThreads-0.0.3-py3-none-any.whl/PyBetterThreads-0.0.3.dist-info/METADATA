PyBetterThreads is a Python library for adding more features to the threading module in Python. 

PyBetterThreads makes it possible to return values from threads, and adds a finished signal so that the user can execute a function once the thread is finished. It is still in early development, and more features will be added soon.

## Installation
You can install PyBetterThreads using pip:
```bash
pip install PyBetterThreads
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use PyBetterThreads:
```python
from PyBetterThreads import BetterThread
from time import sleep

def my_function():
    sleep(5)
    return "Hello, World!"

thread = BetterThread(target=my_function)
thread.start()
thread.connect(print)
```
The above code will print "Hello, World!" after 5 seconds, as once the thread is finished, the returned value will passed to the `print` function. The returned value of the thread will be stored in the `value` attribute of the thread.

You can also use the `join` method to wait for the thread to finish and get the returned value, instead of connecting a function to the thread:
```python
from PyBetterThreads import BetterThread
from time import sleep

def my_function():
    sleep(5)
    return "Hello, World!"

thread = BetterThread(target=my_function)
thread.start()
thread.join()
print(f"The thread returned: {thread.value}")
```
The above code will print "Hello, World!" after 5 seconds, as once the thread is finished, the returned value will be stored in the `value` attribute of the thread.

## Features
- [x] Return values from threads
- [x] Execute a function once the thread is finished
- [ ] More features coming soon!
