    This class provides base functionality specific to tools which
    process each file separately.

    Most tools will override :py:meth:`handle_file`, performing a code review
    on the provided file.

    If a tool would like to perform a different style of analysis, it can
    override :py:meth:`handle_files`.

    #: The compatibility version of the tool.
    #:
    #: This should only be changed for major breaking updates. It will break
    #: compatibility with existing integration configurations, requiring
    #: manual updates to those configurations. Any existing configurations
    #: referencing the old version will not be run, unless an older version

    #: or specific filenames they should process. Each entry is a
    #: glob file pattern (e.g., ``*.py``, ``.config/*.xml``, ``dockerfile``,
    #: etc.), and must be lowercase (as filenames will be normalized to
    #: lowercase for comparison). See :py:mod:`fnmatch` for pattern rules.
    #:
    #: Tools can leave this empty to process all files, or can override
