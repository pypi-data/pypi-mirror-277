4. Now start conversation with GitHub Copilot.

#### Rating the message

You can rate the message by clicking the thumbs up or thumbs down button on the chat window. But this project can't
catch the rating. That's why we developed a way to rate the message manually.

You can rate the message by adding the below comment to the chat window.
These comments will not be visible in chat history. But it will be used to rate the message.

For thumbs down:

```shell
vote:bad
```

For thumbs up:
