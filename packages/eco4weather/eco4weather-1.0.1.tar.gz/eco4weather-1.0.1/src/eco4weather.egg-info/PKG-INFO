======================

This repository provides tools for exploration of economical application as social planner applied in mitigation to facilitate the academic use and the dissemination. The models are in Python and illustrated in Jupyter notebooks.

Codes are available under [CeCILL-B](./LICENCE.txt)



Examples
---

The package can be used to illustrate numerical solution of social planner problem. For instance:

### Ramsey model
