# DRAGON

## IMPORTANT
- Early stages of development. Some classes work, some don't. Dont test until version 1!!!
- Basically, barely functional... almost one-directional

## Purpose
- Provide convenient higher-level interfaces for faster devops

## Why the name
- nogard is DRAGON backwards
- Moves on from the incompentence of COBRA, almost in a backwards fashion

## When to expect
- Give it about a month when I work on it... not sure yet. Not as much of a priority right now.

## Where is it at
- DDP to hardcoded SQL works
- SQL back to DDP not tested yet

## Future
- Connection uris (local and remote), connection strategies, and edge intelligence for enterprises
- Dedicated AST with branches for dialects and architectures (to include a GPU component)
- BIGGEST ONE: it only works with one level deep containers, doesn't work with base classes, and doesn't permit typed imports (Service classes and decoupled typing in Python 3.14). For a true COBRA replacement, these three issues need to be solved!
