1. Install the extension
2. Navigate to the settings for the extension in VS Code. `Extensions > Tach`
3. Add two arguments to `Tach:Args`:
   1. `--root`
   2. `path/to/tach.yml/dir`
4. Run `Tach: Restart Server` from the command palette (`CMD+SHFT+P`)
5. That's it! You should see invalid imports highlighted as errors on save.
