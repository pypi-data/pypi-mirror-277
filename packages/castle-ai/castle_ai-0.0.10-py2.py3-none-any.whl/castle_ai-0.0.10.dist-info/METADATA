# CASTLE


[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/castle-ai.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/castle-ai)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CASTLE-ai/castle-ai/blob/main/notebooks/colab.ipynb)

CASTLE integrates the strengths of visual foundation models trained on large datasets possess open-world visual concepts, including Segment Anything (SA), DeAOT, and DINOv2, for one-shot image segmentation and unsupervised visual feature extraction. Furthermore, CASTLE employs unsupervised multi-stage and/or multi-layer UMAP clustering algorithms to distinguish behavioral clusters with unique temporal variability. 

# Install

## Step 1 Install CASTLE Core Function
```
pip install castle-ai
```



## Step 2 Install xFormer and GPU Version of UMAP (Optional for Speed Up)

For CUDA 12 Users
```
pip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -U cudf-cu12 cuml-cu12 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com 
```


For CUDA 11 Users
```
pip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -U cudf-cu11 cuml-cu11 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com 
```

## Step 3 Download Web UI
```
git clone https://github.com/CASTLE-ai/castle-ai.git
```

## Step 4 Download Pretrained Model

for Linux/Mac user
```
cd castle-ai/
sh download_ckpt.sh
```

for Windowns user
```
cd castle-ai/
mkdir ckpt
# Then, download the models from the web and put them into the ckpt folder.
```


## Run
```
python app.py
```
