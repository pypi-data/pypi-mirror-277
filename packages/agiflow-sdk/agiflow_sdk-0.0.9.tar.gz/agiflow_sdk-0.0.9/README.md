# agiflow-sdk

Agiflowâ€™s Python SDK allows you to easily start monitoring and debugging your LLM execution. Tracing is done in a non-intrusive way, built on top of OpenTelemetry. You can choose to export the traces to Agiflow, or to your existing observability stack.

Please visit [Agiflow Python Sdk documentation](https://docs.agiflow.io/libraries/python/getting-started) for details.
