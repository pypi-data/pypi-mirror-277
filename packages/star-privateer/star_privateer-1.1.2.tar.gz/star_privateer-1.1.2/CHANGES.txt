Version 1.1.2
- Uncertainties computed for Gaussian profile now correspond to 
  half width at half maximum (HWHM) instead of ``sqrt (2) * sigma``
  as previously.
- Allow performing an additional fit on the smoothed Lomb-Scargle
  (after the procedural peak analysis) in order to obtain a more
  realistic uncertainty.
- Add possibility (set to True by default) to show measured period
  values on the summary plot.
- The default mask defining an interval around the peak of larger
  amplitude when fitting peaks in WPS, CS and LS has been removed.
- Allow using a false alarm probability threshold to perform the 
  fit in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
- Change background estimation in Lomb-Scargle periodogram considering
  background estimation in a logarithmically-spaced box. 
  Old behaviour is accessible through "snr_flat" option.
- Change pmin and pmax arguments behaviour for profile-fitting functions.
- Change bound configuration for Gaussian profile fitting in Lomb-Scargle 
  in order to remove some pathologic behaviours witnessed with the code 
  (especially Gaussian profile too large with respect to the underlying 
  spectrum)
- Add zero-padding before computing wavelet transform.
- Add sph uncertainties are default parameters returned by compute_sph.
- Include sph uncertainties in features extracted by rotation_pipeline
- Allow passing keyword arguments to ROOSTER RotClass and PeriodSel with
  distinct dictionaries.
- Allow accessing more easily ROOSTER classification information (training and test results plus
  informations on the last run) and selecting set of parameters related to 
  the rotation period.
- Modify the outputs of analysis_pipeline as periods for WPS were missing.

Version 1.1.1
2024-02-19
- Change default normalisation used for the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
- Update fitting strategy for the periodogram peaks. Modify output for the 
  fit function. Allow constraining minimum and maximum period to fit.
- Add additional cleaning step in the ACF post-processing to avoid 
  negative H_ACF and G_ACF.
- Allow having multiple targets with same label for ROOSTER training (allowing 
  to train with independent segments of a given stellar light curve). 
- Add some missing docstrings

Version 1.1

Version 1.0
2023-11-29
- Moving to star_privateer, up and ready to sail uncharted waters.
- Change license to GPL3.0.

Version 0.2.2
2023-11-29
- Correctly set H_ACF and G_ACF which where interverted in previous version of
  the code. ROOSTER instances trained from output of older versions of the code
  should not be used from now on.
