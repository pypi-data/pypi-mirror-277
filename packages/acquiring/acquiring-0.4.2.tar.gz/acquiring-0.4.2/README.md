Payment Orchestration Library for Python.

[![Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/badge.svg)](https://common-changelog.org)


## Overview

Acquiring aspires to be a flexible and effective toolkit for building applications that handle money.
The word "acquiring" is the industry term that means collecting and processing payments from customers.

Some reasons you might want to check it out:

- Stable interface via single PaymentSaga class.
- Flexible internals that can be customized for any payment method, existing AND non-existing.
- Platform agnostic (really!), meant to be plugged into your existing Django project easily.
- Support for all database engines under the Django umbrella.
- The creator is a very nice guy!

## Requirements

- One of the supported versions of Python
- A spirit of adventure

## Installation

Install using pip...

```sh
pip install acquiring
```

Add 'acquiring' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'acquiring',
]
```

## Local development

This project relies on Docker as the main way to test and develop. You can `docker compose build` and be ready to roll.

## Funding

This project was created by Alvaro Duran. You can support his work or give him words of encouragement
by subscribing to [Money In Transit](http://news.alvaroduran.com/), the weekly newsletter that bridges the gap
between payments strategy and technology execution.

Speaking of, a few of the ideas that inspired this project were initially installments of Money in Transit:
