# 7. Type sparingly, but with confidence

From [Hammock driven development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

I code to win.

I'm not in it for the aesthetics, nor the purity of the design. I'm not in it for the prestige, nor the applause.

I write software that solves real problems. So, before writing, I must understand the problem as much as I can.

A line of code is a liability.

But when I write a line of code, I write it on the full confidence of my expertise.

That line of code must exist, or I won't solve the real problem.

Coding to win is caring. About each line.

A careless line of code is a defeat.
