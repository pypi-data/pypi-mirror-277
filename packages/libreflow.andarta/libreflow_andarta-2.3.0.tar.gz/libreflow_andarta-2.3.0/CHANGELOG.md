## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2024-06-06

2.2.0 is skipped to matching with libreflow.flows

### Added

* Create Shots, Assets from Kitsu: for existing entities, default tasks are now updated, in case new tasks need to be added.
* Creation of shots and assets from Kitsu: an option can be checked to create the task default files enabled by default in the task manager.
* The session provides a new command-line option `--search-auto-indexing` to enable the search engine's automatic indexing. This feature can also be enabled by defining the `SEARCH_AUTO_INDEXING` variable in the environment of the session launch script.
* The session now uses the new Kabaret's layout manager which is enabled by default with the session autosave feature.

### Changed

* The padding of the default sequence and shot name filters in *MyTasks* settings are now 2 and 4 respectively.
* This is now possible to select asset libraries and types to create respectively in the `CreateKitsuAssetLibs` and `CreateKitsuAssetsFromTypes` action dialogs from the available ones in Kitsu.
* Clean and harmonise log messages with the session logger for a better readability.

### Fixed

* A `kitsu_name` parameter has been added to the `AssetLib` and `AssetType` classes. This parameter is hidden and not editable by default, and is used by `CreateKitsuAssetLibs` and `CreateKitsuAssetTypes` actions to retrieve the Kitsu episodes and types assets belong to (instead of relying on the mapped name or code).
