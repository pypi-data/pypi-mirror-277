<H1>VariKN Language Modeling Toolkit manual page</H1>

Variable-order Kneser-Ney smoothed n-gram model toolkit is a
specialized toolkit created for growing and pruning Kneser-Ney
smoothed n-gram models. If you are looking for a general purpose
language modeling toolkit, you probably should look elsewhere (for
example <a href="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/">SRILM
toolkit</a>).

<H2>General</h2>

<H3>File processing features</H3>
The tools support reading and writing for plain ascii files, stdin and
stdout, gzipped files, bzip2 compressed files and UNIX pipes. Whether a
file should be used as is, or uncompressed is determined by the file
suffix (.gz, .bz2, .anything_else). Stdin and stdout are denoted by
"-". The reading from a pipe can be forced with the unix pipe symbol
(for example "| cat file.txt | preprocess.pl", note the leading "|").

<H3>Default tags</H3>
The sentence start "&lt;s&gt;" and end "&lt;/s&gt;" should be put marked to the
training data by the user. It is also possible to train models without
explicit sentence boundaries, but this is not theoretically
justified. For sub-word models, the tag "&lt;w&gt;" is reserved to
signify word break. For sub-word models with sentence breaks the data
is assumed to processed in the following format:
<pre>
&lt;s&gt; &lt;w&gt; w1-1 w1-2 w1-3 &lt;w&gt; w2-1 &lt;w&gt; w3-1 w3-2 &lt;w&gt; &lt;/s&gt;
</pre>
where wA-B is the Bth part of the A:th word.<P>

Counts2kn trains a Kneser-Ney smoothed model from the training data
using all n-grams up to given order n and then possibly pruning the model.

<a name="simpleinterpolate2arpa">
<H3>simpleinterpolate2arpa</H3></a>
    Outputs an approximate interpolation of two arpa backoff models. Exact interpolation
    cannot be expressed as an arpa model. <I>Experimental code.</I><P>

simpleinterpolate2arpa "lm1_in.arpa,weight1;lm2_in.arpa,weight2" arpa_out<P>

<H2>Examples</H2>
To train a 3-gram model do:<br>
counts2kn -an 3 -p 0.1 -o held_out.txt train.txt model.arpa<br>
or<br>
counts2kn -asn 3 -p 0.1 -o held_out.txt train.txt.gz model.arpa.bz2<br>
Adding the flag "-s" reduces the memory use, but limits the vocabulary
< 65000. <P>

To evaluate the just created model:<br>
perplexity -t 1 -a model.arpa.bz2 test_set.txt -
<br>
or <br>
perplexity -S stream_out.txt.gz -t 1 -a model.arpa.bz2 "| cat test_set.txt | preprocess.pl" out.txt
<br>

Note, that for evaluating a language model based on subword units, the
parameter -t 2 should be used since the two first tokens (sentence
start and word break) are assumed to be known.
<P>

To create a grown model do:<br>
varigram_kn -a -o held_out.txt -D 0.1 -E 0.25 -s -C train.txt grown.arpa.gz<P>

<H2>Known needs for improvement</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The documentation should be improved.

<LI>The structure for storing the n-grams could be implemented more
efficiently. This requires a lot of work as the code has shortcuts
past the function interface for efficiency. Will be implemented when/if I
need more efficient memory handling.
