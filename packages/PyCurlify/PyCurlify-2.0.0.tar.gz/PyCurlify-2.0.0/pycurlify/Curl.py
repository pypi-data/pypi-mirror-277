    """
    A class extending BaseCurl to provide simplified methods for making HTTP requests.

    Curl extends the functionality provided by BaseCurl to offer simplified methods for making common HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS.

    Attributes:
        Inherits all attributes from BaseCurl.

    Methods:
        __init__(self): Initializes a new instance of the Curl class.
        get(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None): Sends a GET request to the specified URL.
        post(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None, data=None): Sends a POST request to the specified URL with optional headers, cookies, and data.
        put(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None, data=None): Sends a PUT request to the specified URL with optional headers, cookies, and data.
        options(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None): Sends an OPTIONS request to the specified URL.
        delete(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None): Sends a DELETE request to the specified URL.
        patch(self, url, headers=None, cookies=None, params=None, data=None): Sends a PATCH request to the specified URL with optional headers, cookies, and data.

    Example Usage:
    ```
    curl = PyCurl()
    curl.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    response = curl.response()
    print(response)
    ```
