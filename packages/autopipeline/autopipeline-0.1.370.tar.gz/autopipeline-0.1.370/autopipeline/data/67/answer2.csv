We haven't had one in over 20 years.
My Aunt looked lovely and thanked me for the compliment.
My Uncle still smoked a lot.
There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family.
There were some nice mashed potatoes to eat.
They had gravy on the side.
There was a big cake to share with everybody.
It was a chocolate cake.
We vowed to keep in touch.
I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see.
He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up.
He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed.
My grandma was there too I had my issues in the past with her but it was still nice to see her.
She treated my mom poorly so we don't talk much but I put aside my issues just for this small time period to make the gathering go smooth.
I got to see my favorite aunt and uncle who both shared similar passions to me with computers and tech stuff and it's been like 20 years since I saw them so that was sweet.
Basically they are the same as I remember just older but they are just as into tech stuff as they were back then.
I remember I would bring my GameBoy or old PC games over to their house and they would know about them or have them themselves.
Just really good memories honesty that I was happy to remember with how stressful life has been.
This might have been the last time a lot of us get to meet because we all live so far apart and aren't exactly wealthy so we tried to make the most of it.
I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.
We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace.
We got to really spend some time together that wasn't rushed and catch up on at least a decade worth of misc stuff.
It was surprising how much fun it was because I always had memories of being bored out of my mind.
I guess when you're a kid/teen you would rather be doing other stuff but now that I'm an adult I understood the value of it.
I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to squander these moments as we never know if they will be the last.
Some of my family had passed away in the time frame from when we last met up for the holidays and the reunion so I won't ever get to spend time with them again and that sucks.
I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide.
I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact.
We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest.
I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family.
I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try.
I will look at my relationships with my distant family and friends more so we stay more connected.
It was great to write about this again because I feel like this is a different view from the last time since I have been chatting with my family more since the last time I did this.
Absolutely not.
"As far as pressure from your parents, unless they are providing you with the money to attend and the money to give the couple, they should let it rest."
it was an nice experience i had ever.
i wish them live long and happy.
they both are made for each other.
she is my bestie.
we had lot of memories.
we are childhood friends.
she was very special to me.
we are family friends.
we always going outing together.
we had good and bad memories.
i am very happy.
and proud to have a friend like this.
it was very pleasure to share this.
still we are very close to each other.
I haden't a clue what the problem could be.
It had been 13 years since I was told that I'd never be able to have another child.
"I was completely confused,terrified,shocked,amazed &a thousand other things."
But this time would be much different.
She was my rock.
Was this her way of giving me the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.
Only time would tell how this would turn out.
Would I be strong enough to do this without her?
Or would I just fall apart completely.
My main support system was gone.
"Every time id became a parent,my mom was there by my sidem welcoming my little one with open arms."
The one i needed when no one else was there .
was gone.
This will be extremely hard.
I know that she is watching us from heaven.
Protecting us as we live our lives.
It doesn't make 9t easier though.
I really loved being able to get together and learn more about art.
It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee.
We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot.
It was also a great way to get the kids involved.
This was a really great experience for me because I paint often.
I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration.
I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools.
My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out.
"It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images."
What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much.
This was a great experience that opened my eyes to new things.
I think I may try using acrylics next time I am in front of the canvas.
I then was instructed to have some of the donuts and water that had been brought.
I was told that they lived on the block.
It took a couple hours but it looked great.
"I had wanted to paint a part of the mural that I could come back and say, I did that."
It had already been drawn so I got the grey paint mixed and started to paint it.
It was a fun time painting the manatee.
"The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted."
"When I was finished with the outline, it looked great and everyone was really happy with it."
I then took a picture of it and went home happily knowing that there was a manatee painted on that street by me.
The sun was starting to come up and it was going to be a very hot day but the fun of painting in the street helped to make you forget all of that.
I soon finished with the help of others the sun beams.
A young girl was wanting to help paint too so I offered to share the manatee.
I directed her to where the paint and brushes were located.
She had a great time helping.
It looked amazing and I had a great feeling to know that I could drive by the mural and see my manatee that we painted.
It also made me encouraged o do more  paintings in the future.
"I mean, WHO HITS HER KID??!!"
Especially when it was for something so dumb like not cleaning my room.
"Yea I know I should have just cleaned it, but it's not THAT serious."
I just cant get past it.
I want mom to say at least she's sorry for it and then maybe we can move on.
I can't forgive it right now.
"I want her to acknowledge she did something wrong, for once."
She never admits anything.
She thinks she's right about EVERYTHING!
"UGH, so frustrating."
Sometimes I just hate her.
Why do parent's do that.
"Just say, oops I made a big mistake and it wont happen again."
I want our relationship to go back to when we were happy and talking.
I can't even look at her these past 2 weeks.
"Ok, that's all for now, I'll type more later."
She asked me was I going to let her see the kids.
Everybody keeps saying she changed I should not hold my childhood against her.
But shouldn't I?
When I was finally ready to give her a chance that went all the way left.
I asked her how did I get burned why do i have what looks like cigarette marks on my body ?
And her response was God has already forgiven me for what I have done.
I remember being so taken a back by what she said I didn't even know how to answer.
How could she deny me the information because God forgave her.
I wanted to scream What about me the person who all this crap happened too?
But I didn't I just didn't say anything.
Its easy for people to say you should forgive when they are not the ones who have been wrong.
I have children of my own and I know sometimes parenting is Hard.
But I have never wanted to hurt my kids.
And when i make a mistake I come back and i say im sorry.
Why couldnt she have least done that?
"So no she will never be in my life and that includes my kids life and m fine with that,"
I smile sometimes and say oh yeah and change the subject other times I ask questions about the so called visit.
My cousin wants to know if I will let the kids see the kids this time.
I hate her for asking the question.
Why should i let her see them why should they know her has she earned the right?
There are people that say you should forgive and forget .
Im not one of those people I fell you should never forget especially when a person refuses to give you closure.
I stood there shocked thinking well dont you think you should want forgiveness from me too.
But of course I got nothing not even a sorry .
So no she will not be able to see my kids.
Just so they should be come attached and  maybe become victims of the same abuse I did.
That would make me a responsible.
Because I Know what she is capable of.
Even if others are fooled by her sweetness.
She always talkes about chursh and loving god but where was that love when i was little.
Surely god saw what you did to me .
Surely he say how you treated me didnt you care a bout his approval then.
I wish I wasnt so bitter.
It was barely enough income to get by on and not enough for my budget to include savings.
"Within a matter of a few months, I was consigned to wander through the streets that used to be mine."
"That park is now a place to hide away from the rest of the world, so like a leper."
It seems just yesterday that I'd belonged with those people who come for the fresh open space.
"My eyes now  follow their peaceful smiles, their kids full of crisp laughter as they casually walk about the grounds."
They're spending a pleasant holiday hours just seizing a chance to drift and dream.
That's very different than being me who is now a drifter who never dreams anymore.
"Much of the time I stay huddled far back into the rich foliage, under old blankets and plastic."
"I've ceased dreaming and now know only the nightmare of little to no food, warmth, or affection, and all I can feel is fear."
I don't understand why this happened to me.
I didn't do anything wrong; I just lost my job.
"Several losses followed-- my apartment, belongings, my pets, even my friends."
I hold onto my faith fiercely hoping a miracle might come along.
"No one 'lied' to me, but the American Dream, at least for myself, was filled with untruths."
"The idea, of course, if that if you go to college, get married, have kids, buy a house...etc, that you will experience a life full of joy."
Of course I realized this too late.
"I already have a wife, kids, house and lots of college debt."
I now spend my days working to pay interest to the same people who probably made up the story on how to be happy.
"We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy."
"Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it."
Find another job. Move.
"However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy."
"Well, at least not if you have a conscious."
There is a scene in the movie 'Office Space' that really strikes home.
"In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life."
I feel him.
"My memorable event was not something that happened 'to me,' but an awakening inside me."
"I now find myself thinking about this each day, planning how I might change things, trying to find the courage to become the person I want to be, to live the life I have always wanted."
Too bad I have been living the life others told me would make me happy.
"October, I feel you."
Birthdays and holidays are slowly coming into focus.
The end of the year is near.
I enjoy January 1st.
"Not the recounting of another year gone, or resolutions and promises unfulfilled, but the opportunity to begin anew."
"Yes, I will make promises I will never keep."
I know who I am though.
My intentions are good.
I'll promise to read more.
"A few classics, a few books for guilty pleasures."
I'll promise myself to exercise more.
Get healthy and have more energy for my kids when I get home.
I'll promise to volunteer.
"Leaving the world a better place, making connections with those around me, doing good when no one is looking."
I'll make promises to travel more.
"This is never really a promise, but a reminder that life is short, the world is small, and if I do not put time aside to see new places 'that day' will never come."
"So, October, I guess I am glad to see you."
You are my first step in winter to a new year.
I have been unlucky with love for much of my life.
It's crazy because the same can be said for my friend Megan.
We have always been close but never really spoke of being interested in each other romantically.
It's funny but we just never seemed to be single at the same time.
We hit it off perfectly.
"We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense."
We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other.
"This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends."
Most of them will think we are crazy too.
But sometimes that can be inevitable with a big group of friends like we have.
I know right now that Megan and I seem like a perfect match.
"Hopefully we will last and can continue to have fun together, regardless of what our friends say."
She's an old girlfriend of mine.
And I'm sponsoring her in a twelve-step program.
"Getting romantically involved is very taboo in a twelve-step program, especially among sponsors and sponsees."
We hadn't seen each other face-to-face in years.
We went out to eat that night.
But we've been doing great since.
We decided that we wanted to get closer.
"It was worth the risk, we both agreed."
"I must admit, the 'wrong' nature of what we did sort of made it more appealing."
I think she would agree with that.
People of the same gender aren't supposed to sponsor one another in 12-Step programs.
I helped her work the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous; she worked the Steps on her codependency.
We kept things 'professional' and friendly for a few months.
The relationship was taboo in that it's very frowned upon to date a sponsee.
It is also frowned upon to sponsor someone in a different 12-Step program.
But we became romantically involved anyway.
"It was very difficult to talk about this with anyone because we got very little support, as would be expected."
But things are going well with us.
We have more or less proved everyone wrong.
"We are very happy, and, to be honest, we are one of the healthiest couples I know."
"I have high hopes for us, and she does, too."
It has been the first time in a decade that we've been under the same roof.
He will be very happy with the mansion he is moving into.
I hope he doesn't get too greedy.
I hope his life will have meaning.
"At the party, I got a little too drunk."
He got a little mad.
He forgave me.
It was a destination wedding.
I was not too far away.
We were able to drive there in 4 hours.
Quite a few guests did travel via airlines.
I have an adult son 35 who lives in Dallas.
We don't get to see him a lot.
She was a lovely girl and it was great to meet her.
They are still together.
The last time we all gathered she was very young.
This wedding was at a beautiful bed and breakfast.
The weather was gorgeous.
The most surprising thing was it hit me how old we all have gotten!
There were 4 generations of the family there.
Jimmy is roughly the same age as my son.
They grew up together.
We spent vacations visiting my folks and my brother  lived in the area.
"So Jim would always be around, vacations holidays etc."
I had not seen his dad in many years.
A beautiful lake that the wedding venue looked over.
Again the reason it was meaningful to me was it had been 10+ years since I had seen many of the people.
My wife and I actually were thinking that we last saw them when my wife was pregnant with our 12 year old daughter.
It was fun for the 3 of us also to dance together.
I was always making excuses not to go back to school and complete my Masters degree.
"Before long over 20 years passed and I realized something was missing, I wanted a Masters degree, it never left my mind."
"But what really matters on this special day is not only proving to myself I could do it, but showing my Daughter to never give up."
"I remember what started me on this quest, my parents wanted me to be 'educated' and in their eyes it meant a Masters degree."
"The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it."
"I could see it in their eyes, how very much they wanted me to complete my education, I felt that drive in them, that sense of pride they would have in me."
"They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day."
"At first she could not grasp the meaning of it all to me, the sense of gratitude I had for my parents as well as what it meant to them for me to get my higher level degree."
"I finally got through to my daughter about how I felt, how my parents felt and how to me it tied in with her getting her Masters on the same day."
"She always knew how I beam with pride over her, all her accomplishments and dedication to studying."
"It brought me great happiness to be able to share the day with her, to get a degree the same time she did."
"I feel inside now a true sense of calm, knowing my family is proud of me, I set a good example for my daughter and my parents can rest."
"I told my daughter my life is finally complete, and I feel a true sense of circle and self, and that my parents can finally rest in peace with an oath kept."
It was a beautiful day.
"The sun was shining, it was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky."
I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal.
This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier.
"Due to starting a family shortly after receiving my Bachelors degree, I had put off getting my Masters until my life had settled and I was financially capable of achieving this goal."
Did I need the Masters degree?
Would it change my life?
Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful?
"Well, yes I did need the degree and yes it would change my life."
I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family.
It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it.
So many emotions ran through my mind.
Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here?
I knew that they were looking down upon me and this day and were just as proud as they would have been if they were here to see it with their own eyes.
She has always been proud of here Dad but I know that she was more excited about my graduation than hers.
I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me.
I imagined my Mom crying and my Dad holding back tears of Joy.
She was overcome with emotion as well.
"Upon receiving her degree, she ran to me and told me that she was proud of me."
"As a child, my parents always pushed me to be my best."
They made sure I got good grades in school and always kept tabs on my progress.
"I told my daughter that I promised them that I would get my Masters and now that they were gone, I was even more determined to keep that promise."
I knew that my parents would be so proud of me.
I felt good though because I knew that my daughter was going to be right by my side.
I had never felt so at peace with myself.
I was so proud of my daughter and I knew that 2 other people were looking down on me with the same pride.
This was a day that I will never forget.
"Dear Diary, today I've been doing a lot of thinking about my cousin's wedding."
"It was such a beautiful day, and I was & still am so happy that she found her person."
But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her.
"Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy."
"I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out."
As if standing up in front of all those people wasn't enough pressure.
"Now, I thought, I'd have to either do it with a giant wet stain down my front, or change and be the only person in the wedding party wearing old, ripped jeans."
"I even thought, for a moment, about just sitting the whole thing out."
"But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman."
"It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest."
"I know it's probably not as big of a deal as I make it out to be, but I've always been prone to anxiety."
My cousin is so important to me and I just couldn't stand the thought of ruining her big day.
She's waited so long for it.
"Thankfully, it all went according to plan and she's got perfect, champagne-stain-free photos to look back on and remember forever."
I'm so happy it all worked out in the end.
I was a bridesmaid in the wedding and it was beautiful.
She wore a lace dress.
We wore blush colored bridesmaids dresses.
She and I are very close so it was great to see her marrying someone she loves.
I was panicked.
We got the dress back right before we had to walk down.
"Then, the reception was so much fun because it was filled with family."
It was very emotional because she was so happy and we were all grown up.
"During the toasts, everyone cried."
It was very emotional to see them so happy.
It was definitely the best wedding I've been to and one I will never forget.
It was a beautiful wedding and we had been helping her plan it for months.
"The day had gone perfectly, so far."
Everyone got together in the morning to get their hair and makeup done.
My cousin looked gorgeous and everything was set to go.
I panicked and felt terrible.
I was so scared that I ruined the dress and the day.
We called my Aunt to come in and she immediately had me take off the dress.
She cleaned up the stain somehow.
"After that, she held the dress under a dryer."
"Miraculously, the stain came out and it dried in time."
"After that, we walked down the aisle and no one could tell!"
The wedding went on without a hitch.
Everyone was so happy.
It was great to see my cousin so happy.
I enjoyed celebrating with her and had a great time.
I was at college that week and it was the final week of classes before finals.
Mom always was talking about Shelly and how old she was getting but we all were dreading this day.
Shelly was my best friend throughout my life.
She got me through the school transfer in 6th grade and was my rock.
I couldn't believe it when I got the call that she was in the hospital because she stopped eating.
I prayed that she would hold on long enough so that I could drive back after finals and see her one last time and tell her how much she meant to me.
Shelly was the nicest Boxer a family could ever ask for and I needed to see her off before she passed on.
"On the way there Mom called, and gave me the news."
Shelly was the only dog I've ever had but she was the best.
She was such a good girl and I wish I could have been there in her final moments.
My mom said she passed peacefully but I wish I could've been there to hold her as she passed on.
Thank you Shelly.
I was not there.
I had been out of town visiting family.
"In the middle of the night, my only real option as a non-driver was Greyhound."
"As luck would have it, there was a proper route from where I was to where I was going."
"I told them my story; begged, pleaded. Nothing."
"I felt profoundly hopeless, hysterical, self-loathing, and broken."
"I hadn't seen her in her last two months, and I couldn't see her before she went."
It absolutely haunts me.
I still haven't been able to go back home.
It will never feel like home again.
Not without her.
There was a day - a Sunday - when I was planning on going home.
"Immediately, I knew I had to try to get back."
I rushed to get to the station for a very last-minute departure.
I was profoundly crushed.
And upset at myself for letting that happen.
I barely got out of bed for days.
I didn't care about going home anymore.
The thought of being in my house without my dog made it feel haunted.
That's when I knew.
I didn't bother to follow them.
"Such a shame for him that he ended up getting back nearly five hours later, to all his possessions soaked on our front lawn."
I haven't seen him since.
"I had been cheated on in past relationships, and I knew the warning signs."
"I asked him why he was being so weird lately, and he immediately became defensive."
"I knew that this was not going to end well, and I did not want to cause a scene in public."
"So, I said never mind and we ate the rest of our meal in silence."
"I was fully expecting to come over to his house and sleep over as we usually did, but he obviously did not have the same idea as me."
I asked him why and he told me that he wasn't feeling well and just wanted to go lay down.
"Every part of me wanted to start an argument then and there but I stopped myself, and just remained quiet while he dropped me off."
I was completely devastated.
"I was incredibly angry and upset with him at first, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him."
"But, as time passed, he continued to try to contact me."
"I do not regret my decision, and I do believe that our relationship is stronger than it was before."
"I do sometimes get feelings of suspicion or feelings that he is going to cheat on me once again, but I try to see past those feelings because I know that he really loves me."
They would have told me that I need to know my self worth and that I should be with someone who would never do that to me.
"I agree, but I think he made a mistake that hopeful he will learn from and we will overcome as a couple."
I do not want to be one of those girls who gets repeatedly cheated on and stays anyway.
I will not let that be me.
But i am truly hoping that he will change as a person.
I couldn't be prouder.
I was finally done.
"The pay was okay, but it was more about finally being able to do what I love, what I spent so long trying to achieve."
"The pay is horrendous, it's almost like the government doesn't want kids to learn anything."
Cheap backpacks and notebooks apparently add up.
But these kids...
They need me.
"I feel like I am right where I am supposed to be, helping these kids."
Even if I end up having to get a part-time job on top of this to make ends meet.
This is something that I have been dreaming about for years.
I realized that this was likely the last time that I would attend a graduation as a student.
"That is, unless I decide to go back for my doctorate degree."
"However, whether I decide to go back for another graduate-level degree or not, the accomplishment of getting my master's degree can never be taken away from me."
"I realized that the next time I attend a graduation will likely be for my students, since I am trying to teach high school level students."
It feels nice to pass the torch to them.
I was hopeful to find a job for the 2019-2020 school year.
"However, there were not very many teaching jobs available during this time period."
This was true for all subjects.
It was because I did not have experience.
This is not as good of a job due to financial concerns.
It also sucks to not have my own classroom.
You are not able to establish the same types of relationships with students that you can in your own classroom.
My substitute teaching job is not enough to cover these loans.
I think that they should be more honest with the state of the teacher job market.
I always knew they would get married but it was still kinda surprising and emotional when they announced it.
The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.
She wanted it like that and I was fine with it too.
It was less planning and fanfare which is more her style.
They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.
I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.
It makes it hard because neither will come to family get togethers like Christmas if they know the other is there and this makes me so sad.
I want the whole family together and it's just not the same if one is not there.
So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.
"I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up."
Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.
I am so glad and warmed in my heart that they have made up with each other.
It was tearing my heart apart that they had tension with each other and now I feel so much better.
I just hope they can continue getting along and don't fall back into that horrible state again.
"But it was very legitimate, too."
They had avoided getting married because they're both divorced.
They had a beach theme.
The way she looked at him when exchanging vows was precious.
It was a big thing to do.
They hadn't talked in a year or so.
So that was the best part for me.
I had never seen her so happy.
I vividly remember the look on her face.
It was a rare look of utter joy and being fulfilled.
It's almost like I was feeling it with her.
And it was a big decision for her.
Her life was taking on a new direction and a new meaning.
And having family and friends share her joy just made the occasion one the most memorable days for me.
But I think all the sheer happiness of the day allowed the two of them to sit down and hash things out.
"It was kind of awkward, though."
"So it was nice that that happened, because I wasn't sure it was ever going to."
And I have to wonder if it would have been able to occur had not some Happiness catalyst been there to cause it.
It was sudden and very tragic.
It feels like I was just talking to her and planning our next get together.
We'd planned to go to a concert with my brother and sister in July.
"I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February."
She had been waiting to go that concert for years but hadn't been able to because our work schedules didn't line up.
I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are.
She'd been there for my wife and I through some hard times and was always willing to lend a hand to help us with the children.
I can't believe that she's gone and I know that it's tougher on my wife.
"This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives."
My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time.
I think that if anything good can come out of this is that we'll be more of a bonded family.
We know that's what she would've wanted us to do and we'll honor her in this way.
But I don't think I'll ever stop missing her.
I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert.
It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT.
It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough.
This event was also memorable for one other reason.
My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.
"He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife."
She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.
She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.
We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.
He said it just didn't feel right.
It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed.
We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.
My sister-in-law was a very special person to me and an important part of our lives.
She had some health issues in her adult life.
She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.
It has been 5 months since it happened and it still seems so surreal.
I miss her smile and I miss her laugh.
She had the best laugh!
It will be difficult when our family gets together for the holidays this year but we will pull together and honor her in the best way possible.
It was a hot summer day in April.
I don't usually pick up unknown numbers.
Growing up we had a rocky relationship.
We never really got along and argued a lot.
I felt like he always tried to be my dad and I didn't want him to.
Sometimes our arguments turned physical.
But now that we were on the phone our conversation was calm.
We spoke about my childhood and his relationship with my mother.
It was a rough conversation at first but then it got better over time.
The conversation was emotional and we caught up for a bit before hanging up.
"Then some time in my 20s even that stopped, and for several years we had no contact at all."
It felt really good to be able to bond with my step-father again.
I was glad to find out that he's in good health despite being in his 70s.
We generally were able to catch up on each other's lives.
"He's still working as a substitute teacher from time to time, and I told him I'm working at a restaurant."
It was very sad to hear this as I remember her well from my childhood.
I also know they were very close to one another so I tried to console him the best that I could.
Overall this was a very significant and emotionally moving event for me that I still think about from time to time.
We've since talked a couple more times.
I'm optimistic it will lead to more of a relationship in the future.
My biological dad left when I was a baby so my step-dad was pretty much the sole father figure in my life during some of my formative years (around age four to nine).
He still tried to be there for me but life got in the way.
I shared news about my own health which has also had some bumps in the road.
I was really quite sad and taken aback by this.
It brought up a lot of memories from my childhood of staying over at her house and how nice she was.
It was a nice conversation and moving experience that lasted about half an hour.
It's been good to have him back in my life even in just a small way.
"I knew he was sick, but it was still such a shock."
He used to work in Detroit.
He would clean the car parts in a chemical solution without gloves.
He would just dip them in.
The doctors told him this cancer was only caused by a specific chemical.
"He said, 'kiddo, I love you, I will always take care of you.'"
I thought he meant in the sense of how a parent loves their child after they pass away.
I didn't think anything of it.
Ni biggie.
Did not think of it again til yesterday.
She was my best friend.
I was the classic daddy’s girl.
I signed so much paperwork it all looked the same.
It was just a part of the process.
My parents loved me dearly and spoiled me greatly.
"They always took care of me, even as an adult."
It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death.
As the executor of his estate the funds went to me.
I was floored.
The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference.
I immediately called the law firm and was explained that I had already signed the release and they had all that they needed.
In  my autopilot state I signed all of the paperwork without even realizing it.
And that was just the first round of checks.
My parents found a way to take care of me even in their death.
Nonetheless it was mine now.
I went through the home and went over paperwork that was left.
It was the case in which I received the 12 checks from.
There were a list of payments that were to be made to my father and now to me.
I was astounded.
My parents had been working on this case for years.
I gathered the paperwork and went all the way to the lawyer.
The lawyer explained that this would be ongoing and I would receive many more payments for years to come.
A week later I received 2 more checks.
I am so excited to have gotten my degree and now I can go out in the real world and be a real person.
"But first, it was time to celebrate."
"I can't believe that in all my years of going to college in Utah, I had never made it to Zion."
"Well, here was my chance."
It was soooo beautiful!
It was so nice to be out in fresh air and to just clear my thoughts.
I love me some good food!
"I love it, and when I wear it I will always remember this trip."
It was so inspiring being out in nature and I really appreciate this time I had with my family.
"It was an exciting trip, since I just graduated from college."
"It was also the first family trip we took with the three of us in months, so it was fun to be just with them."
"I was a bit out of shape, so some of the trails were difficult, but I felt happy once I completed them."
My favorite walks on the trail were the paths that lead to waterfalls and hanging gardens.
A lot of the shops were rock and mineral shops.
"There were some nice rocks, but I didn't end up purchasing any."
There were also lots of outdoor stores that had a wide range of supplies.
I got a hat and a water bottle as a souvenir.
"Overall, the trip was very fun and memorable."
"It had been months since I had last seen them, and it was exciting that we were all coming together to celebrate."
"The hotel was next to a bus system that could take us into town, and then into the national park."
"The bus was helpful, since the weather was overcast and rainy."
"Due to the rain, we had less of a selection of trails, but we still made the most of the trip."
My favorite trails went right up to the waterfalls.
"We also visited the nature center, and learned about the wildlife and history of the park."
We brought snacks back to our room and talked about our day.
It's been two months since I saw the doctor for my problem.
"I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then."
Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.
"As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding."
"My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away."
All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.
"All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before."
So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.
It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.
"So now, it's a common problem."
"I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee."
I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.
The doctor had treated my infection but I suspected that I needed a therapist at this point.
"Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too."
"After, a few weeks."
Like go on a run for 30 minutes because i would be wanting to urgently go the bathroom in between my run.
Like passing the baton on to someone else.
"Anyways, I thought my frequency to go to the bathroom would go away with eating fruits and vegetables, but it didn't."
So i have an appointment lined up next week with a urinary specialist.
Hopefully he/she will cure me.
"Okay, it has been several months since i came back from my primary doctor's visit."
My primary doctor gave my phone number to the best specialist at the hospital.
Then it took like a week to hear back from the people who schedule appointments at the hospital.
"It was a matter of me going to hospital to see why they hadn't called me, when my primary doctor said that someone from the hospital would."
"I don't know the exact length, but i had to wait a couple of weeks just so he can hear my side of the story and see what steps he can take with me."
But it didn't.
"But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now."
I wish the health care industry in america would be a lot more efficient and not have someone that is poor and not a lot of money have them wait an eternity for treatment.
"I'm hoping this will end good, not bad."
"Hope for a speedy recovery, so i can go back to work like i used to 2 years ago."
What a wild ride this life has been so far.
"The ups, the downs and everything in between."
"As I reflect back, I think to how nervous I was to even ask her to marry me."
I practiced what I would say for months and just couldn't work up the nerve.
"She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn."
We stayed the Mirage just up the street and just had the most wonderful time.
"The last two years have just been so amazing, I can't wait to see what the future holds."
She came back with some ideas and I went from there.
I think I got very lucky.
It was on her birthday and we decided to go to the resturant where we went on our first date at.
He was then relaxed and thought I should get on with it.
It was too expensive to leave on the porch so he had to leave a note and I missed him the day before.
I needed it that night to ask her to marry me as well.
So with the ring nervously in my pocket we went to dinner and I dont think she even knew.
It finally came time to ask her and people were seemingly ready to leave.
So I had to do it.
I had to finally ask her or I'd have to find another time and be super nervous all over again.
"We were pretty happy to share the moment with my family, her family and our son."
The resturant printed off the menu for us and it said congrats to us.
I'm glad I finally asked her.
I always knew her life would turn this way.
"Sad to say, I know."
I was realistic about it.
I was logical.
"Weirdly so, while I was realistic about it, I felt that I was also in denial about many things."
It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were.
I remember it all sinking in.
I was disappointed.
It was hurtful.
I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal.
She was selfish for a very long time.
I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise.
I am not even sure that's what caused it.
Maybe the timing was just a coincidence.
I never imagined it would cause her life to unravel.
"Again, I don't even know if me cutting her out of my life was what caused her life to unravel."
"I imagine it played somewhat of a role, though."
"I don't really know why I was shocked, though."
She never really was on the right track in life.
Her alcoholism finally caught up with her.
My family was torn apart by it and I decided not to stick around for it.
I still can't believe that she is going to do it.
"Having parents that were divorced and growing up in that environment, is the last thing I wanted for the kids."
I don't think that my wife realizes how this is going to impact the kids.
All I wanted was to restore our family.
I miss my wife.
I miss us being a family.
"I continue to pray for healing and restoration, but I'm losing hope."
"I know God is in control, but I am struggling."
All I can do is focus on God and be strong for the kids and let them know that we are still a family.
So then what happens to the family?
The husband will not file for divorce.
Which puts the family in a trap that no one can seem to get out of.
"The parents are separated, the family is separated, do they still do things together."
No one can seem to move forwards together or a part.
"It is a family in crisis, that they can't seem to get out of."
So where does this family go from here?
"And how can this family move on, when 1 person wants nothing but reconciliation and the other person can't make up their mind."
"And in the middle of this, are two kid's who just want their family back together."
"We spent a large majority of our time riding our favorite rides, and just pretending we were children again."
"We rode almost all of the rides, and re-lived our first date."
"It was our first time there, and we were a bit overwhelmed with all of the rides and activities there, but we had a great time."
"To be honest, we had more fun at the water park than we did at Orlando, we were there for hours!"
"One was definitely one of the smallest ones we have been to, but it had a lot of charm to it."
"The last one we went to, was a very massive one, almost the size of the Disney world one in Orlando."
I think our last theme park was the best one.
The rides were fantastic.
The food was amazing.
The prices were reasonable.
"After it was all said and done, we were very happy with our decisions and had a fantastic time."
We chose this because we both love rollercoasters and it fit our budget.
We were both very excited about it.
The first park was called holiday world and was in Santa Clause Indiana.
We were there long enough for a day in the park and the city.
They have a coaster that pulls so many G's everyone blacks out or gets close to it.
We spent a night and day in the city.
We spent three days.
This was we made sure to take in as much as the city had to offer.
I had never seen it from the Canadian side.
It was way more impressive than from the American side.
"However, because of our schedules, we couldn't go on our honeymoon until June 2019."
"Prior to the honeymoon I had some very important work due, and I was really looking forward to the time to have fun."
We started at Holiday World in Indiana.
"They had amazing roller coasters, including one named Voyage, that is now in my top five of all time."
They also had tons of great water rides.
"It was a small park, but had some nice coasters."
"Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open."
The park was amazing.
We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers.
The most memorable part of the Honeymoon was probably the first park.
It was so good and we had the rush of the vacation just beginning.
"I came face-to-face with how I was truly missing out on life, on what matters most."
"Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now."
The day started like any other day.
"I mindlessly went through my routine, made sure my spouse was ready for work, and dropped my kid off at school."
Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.
"That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school."
"I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school."
"There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway."
"I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it."
My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.
"She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy."
I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?
Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?
"Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?"
"Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?"
"I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list."
"All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by."
"I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life."
Each day is precious:  I will remember and truly learn to live.
Life happens so quickly that sometimes you don't realize how much of it has passed.
You just wake up each day and go through the same routine as though you're on auto pilot.
"You wake the kids, walk the dog and go to work then the next thing you know the work day is over then it's back home to get ready for bed and start the cycle all over again."
Days turn into weeks and weeks into months and you wonder where the time went while waiting to reach this destination of happiness you've been longing to find for as long as you can remember.
"Recently, in one of those brief moments of wonder and longing I did more than reminisce over time and it's elusive passing."
I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left.
I keep waiting for this happiness like it's a destination when I had to remind myself that being happy is a mood.
"Sometimes it's brief and sometimes it's replaced by sadness, bitterness, or anger."
"I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option."
After I actually done this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had planned to retire from.
"I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over."
I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work.
This was almost 3 weeks ago.
"It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding."
"This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it."
"I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park."
I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot.
For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling.
"I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best."
Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live.
This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.
I always feel like I am not in the moment.
I feel like I'm living my days like a robot and not connecting with anyone.
It's like a lightbulb went off and I realized what all I'm missing out on.
I've been going through the motions of the day and going about my life like a schedule.
"Now, that I finally see what I've been doing I know what I have to change."
It means no more living on auto pilot and loving the same way.
I realize I need to change up the monotonous everyday and show them by actually saying it more out loud and not expecting them to know because I do the standard things everyday that they've come to expect of me.
Everyone needs to truly feel and understand that they're loved which I've realized can't be done on the same monotonous auto pilot mode.
It's time to go outside of the norm and truly show it.
I have literally changed my everyday life from a simple realization.
"By actually showing my love and speaking my truth it has made not only my children much happier and more willing to talk openly to me about what's going on in their lives, but it's also made me so much happier."
Living on auto pilot happens way to often and I feel like I can't be the only one in the same boat.
I feel like my advice when talking with friends and family has really had a positive impact on them as well.
"It's sad that we forget, so often, that our loved ones should just see our love just because we do the things we are required to do to care for one another."
It is not only myself living on auto pilot but me putting my kids on auto pilot and I had to make a change.
It's always been stressful yet rewarding for me over the thousands of hours I have played in this game but my last week's game stands out than the rest.
My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game.
I did not let his words be a distraction nor a way to just give up and surrender.
"Even though I had a mic, I stayed quiet and just typed 'I'm sorry' on chat whenever he screamed at me."
Our towers are down but I kept optimistic on winning.
"Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful."
Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game.
"I would always commend and rate positively my teammates whenever I win, so I did it as well with Slark."
"He is an incredibly good player, good student, and is well-liked."
"However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy."
They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.
"Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes."
"I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help but feel a little pleasure in the how this was handled."
"Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall."
He is incredibly smart and gives all tasks his all.
"He is super friendly, and kind of Ferdinand in that he doesn't like using his size to hurt others."
"He had made some friends, but this core group of kids was hard to crack - especially since Sam had no previous football experience AND the coaches were all father's of this golden crew."
"I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay."
"He seemed a little off that day, but worked hard and had all the plays figured out as he had studied up the night before."
"I'll make you a deal - you stop talking smack about me and treating me like dirt, and I will do my job."
Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?
Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?
So what do you think?
"Are you ready to be nice, or do I need to keep leaving a hole?'"
The whole field was silent - and the kid was so red.
He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!
He was so very liked by many people.
His down to earth and jovial personality will certainly be missed.
We did get together and reminisce about all the good time we had together; including giving him grief about his beloved sports team.
We got news of the funeral.
This took some of us by surprise.
We wanted to show a formal amount of respect.
But I guess this is the way he wanted it.
It was nice to see everyone show up wearing sport jersey.
I think they felt uncomfortably overdressed.
"Ha ha ha, John was probably laughing in the casket!"
The ceremony was nice.
We all paid our respects during the ceremony and at the grave site.
"Here, we all told our stories of John and the experiences we had with him."
"Although there was much laughter, there was also some somber moments."
I for one will remember all the good times I had with John.
I will miss him dearly.
"The following week at work, a number of us talked about Johns service."
We filled in some people who were unable to attend.
He was only 30 years old.
His funeral was just two weekends ago and many came to support his wife and children as they move on with life.
He worked for several years in multiple departments.
His smile and friendly disposition was well known and an great encouragement to many.
"He was known for greeting many with a smile and a 'Hi Boss,' which many acknowledged when remembering him."
"A very nice tribute to a good man, husband and father as well as a great co-worker."
He was a big Tampa Bay Buc fan so many wore their Tampa Bay Buc Jersey's to show their support and love for him.
He leaves behind a young wife of whom I worked with in a different department.
She was also very well liked.
He also leaves behind a teenage son and daughter who must now face life without their dad.
"He fought a very good fight with his cancer battle, never giving up hope."
"Still a young man with a young family, very sad and tragic."
Just a year prior he was healthy and working with a bright future.
The family didn't have any church ties to speak of so his wife and family decided to have a memorial service instead of a traditional church service.
Notice was given to all who knew him to come to an informal gathering where he would be remembered.
There were many in attendance wearing his favorite teams jersey though not all.
They all mingled together talking about the shortness of his life and shock of being loss so young.
There were tears and laughter of times when he had been and encouragement to different attendees he had worked with.
"It was a gloomy day, cloudy day outside with rain on an off."
"However, the crowd inside didn't match the outside gloom as though sad, they were celebratory and thankful for having known him as friend."
We meet many we hadn't seen in sometime and all we happy to see us though not under the circumstances we came for.
A speaker toward the end told of the young man's life while a video played in the background showing him in happier times.
We've seen her and the kids once since his passing and they are getting along.
They miss him of course but it's one of those things in life that we encounter sometimes.
Unexpected bumps in the road that you have to deal with and move on.
He'll forever be in our thoughts and remind us to be thankful for those in our lives that our still with us.
Good reminder to spend time with our love ones and acknowledge them while they are here.
You never know when life will throw one of those bumps in your path.
"Today was like any other day, I was happy and in love."
When I say this came out of nowhere I really mean it.
I woke up and did my morning ritual.
We normally survive on coffee and something simple to eat.
"I might have made a fool of myself, I cringe when I think of it."
I drifted in and out of sleep because when I slept it didn't hurt.
"Not at all, I thought she was the one."
"Should I have seen it coming, yup!"
"She would often travel to see her family which lived over an hour away, sometimes I'd go, sometimes not."
"We found about it, and got on with life."
"So here I am, heartbroken and just me and the dog (and yes, I told her I was keeping him and there wasn't going to be a discussion about it) so what do I do."
"Because I loved her, and I loved her family, and why punish her family by making them do it."
"She made me keep the furniture because it was too much, she said, but everything else that reminded me of her is gone."
"I know what a divorce feels like, well except the whole court/lawyer fee thing."
"I kinda wish I wasn't such a smartass and kept some of it, but I wanted her to know I could do it without her."
Can I though?
MaybeThe dog thinks so anyway
"I have never been more confused in all my life, HOW can I be an 'amazing man' and yet she wants to leave."
So what to do?
"Well, I pack."
"She didn't want to be there, she was coming to get her stuff (eventually), so I began to pack every-single-thing of hers and shove it away."
So I didn't have to see it.
"Pots, pans, utensils, everything that could be taken down or moved was packed."
Anything that reminded me of her.
"I helped load her up and send her on her way to a new life, and I was left trying to rebuild mine... again."
I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories.
It was quite good work and I was quite jealous.
"I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all."
"It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different."
It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas.
"One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe."
The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it.
Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world.
"It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place."
It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.
It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case.
"I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters."
I am also a Texan.
This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).
There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.
The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.
He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling.
"While it isn't 'War and Peace' long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it."
I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.
"It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend."
I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.
"Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book."
As such the others paled in comparison.
It was a western which is outside of my normal book choices.
It was titled 'Lonesome Dove' and was written by Larry McMurtry.
'Lonesome Dove' is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.
The two main characters are Gus and McCall.
They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.
I think it as Montana.
The book had very rich character development.
"There were good guys, bad guys, and in-between guys."
One of the in-between is a girl/woman named Lori.
She is a 'lady of the night' but sweet just the same.
Gus and McCall are kind of the good guys.
The scenery and imagery are very rich.
It is very colorful in terms of the language.
You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.
This made my feet sweaty.
This got resolved and I had the ceremony.
We all had a great time.
I had some tears that I was finally done with school.
I got a meat lovers by myself.
I barely finished the pizza.
I will remember this forever.
I had planned out my to do list as usual prior to the day.
Then on the day came and i called my dry-cleaner service to ask why he hasn't deliver my cloth as promised .
It was same thing.
I thought i was going to loose it .
"because that was my only option ., As i intend to look my best on this day."
I explained my ordeal and he promised to go check on my behalf .
I had no option than to accept his apology even though i was furious.
Family and friends are present already.
"We merry ,laughed."
I was presented my award .I also took pictures with my other graduates .
It was a memorable experience and overwhelming too.
"My family were happy for me,.They were proud of me too.. My mum especially could not hide her joy."
It was a sweet memory.
I can never forget this day.
As if that was not enough.
It was fun all night.
"The music was loud , there were enough drinks to go round."
The girls were dancing and happy.
The guys were having good laughs and drinks.
There were alcohol for everyone.
we really had mad fun all this while till when suddenly.
He was rushed by the guys for help.
I think he had too much to drink not considering his health.
One of us attended to him by giving him CPR .
"after sometime , he gain consciousness ."
He only wants to go home as he was hungover .
He made sure he threw-up the alcohol intake from the party.
Daniel decided to stay with him to keep eye on him.
"I left for my place and when i got home ,dinner was set."
Had dinner with my family.
"Thinking back, I guess I struggled socially because of the way I was treated through school."
He reassured me that it was a safe procedure and would greatly improve the appearance.
I could barely sit still during those three months because I was overcome with joy and anxiousness.
And once everything finally healed it was absolutely unbelievable!
The doctor did a fabulous job!
My eyes look normal for the first time in my life.
Now I do not have to be so self conscious about the way I look.
I can't wait to go to my 10 year high school reunion and see everyone's faces!
"I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye."
"I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem."
"Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly."
"He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer."
The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double.
The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some.
"She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction."
"I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation."
"She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August."
"My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me."
Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed.
This is no longer a problem!
It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!
I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches.
My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches.
She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them.
"After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation."
"My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader."
This was wonderful news!
Recovery went well.
I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls.
"The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by."
I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed.
It has really changed my life in so many ways.
I am not one for bad news.
"I was my Uncle's favorite niece, my best friend was the only one I could confide in, and my dog was my partner."
No amount of condolences could ever made this right.
I am not okay with prepared or unprepared deaths.
I am still so far negative.
I do positive things in their memory.
"She was old for a mastiff, 13 years old."
She was acting off and wasn't interested in much.
So I was home alone.
It seemed like it happened so quickly.
One moment she was there.
As the day wore on and it got closer to the time to go to the service I knew I couldn't leave her.
There was no way that I was leaving my dog alone.
I laid her head on my lap.
I told her stories about our life together.
I told her that it was okay to go.
It would hurt me worse than I could imagine but I had to let her go.
I knew something was different.
"Blissfully unaware, I enjoyed the prospect of having a new infant in the family to love and spoil as only a grandmother can."
I was shocked to find that she had things in her history that were so terrible that CPS felt the need to investigate and eventually remove the children from her care.
This threw the family into chaos.
"Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own."
"I love her dearly and want nothing but the best for her, but it is hard."
This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions.
Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?
"I want to believe people can change, and I want to believe that someday my son and his family can care for her needs, but I am unsure."
This has been one of the hardest times in my life.
"Although it has been so difficult, my sole focus is on this beautiful child and making sure she has the love, care, and attention that all innocent children deserve."
It is a happy but also a sad day.
My grandchild is a girl and that is happy.
She is healthy and that is happy.
"However, her mother is what brings the sadness."
She has no job and has tattoos all over her body.
"Now, they are involved with this baby."
Basically I now have to raise my grandchild as my own child.
The child spends most of her time with me.
It's hard having them all in the home.
I have been trying to help all of them.
I try to help the mother to understand how to be a mother and to keep clean of drugs.
I try to help the baby to be healthy mentally and physically.
It is something I do every day as the mother does not understand keeping things clean.
I'll be alone with her until about six tonight.
"In truth, I am a sort of part time mother to her."
It will soon be time to put her down for a nap.
I have grown close to her.
I hope every day that she has a bright and safe future.
I worry all the time about what will happen if CPS gives her back to her mother.
My husband and I couldn't have been happier.
We planned out everything.
I didn't know why this was happening to me.
I thought it just meant I wasn't meant to have a baby.
I stayed in bed for weeks.
"That helped us, but we still couldn't get over it."
My husband and I haven't tried again and I don't know if I ever want to.
I'm still not over it.
"I don't want to get my hopes up again and then have to have them crushed, and I don't think my husband does either."
"Hopefully in the next year, I will be back to normal."
"I didn't think that this would actually happen to me, but it did."
"I was told to expect something like this occurring, but I didn't realize that it would actually occur, if that makes sense."
You never think this kind of thing would happen to you until it did.
I still don't really know how to feel.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I don't want to go to school.
I don't want to go to work.
All I want to do is sit at home and do nothing.
"Everyone says that life will go on, but it doesn't feel like it."
I feel like this entire thing went by so fast.
"Three weeks, max?"
It feels like I just blinked and the entire event flew by.
"I can't believe, again, that this would happen to me."
Now I have to face the world without the child growing in my belly.
How can I be around other kids?
How can I deal with seeing other pregnant women?
This is the toughest moment of my life.
"Since I found out I pregnant, I've thought about it every second of every day - I doubt that that will change."
It happened on February 12th 2019.
"I was eight weeks pregnant, so barely there, but enough to know and to feel some symptoms."
I found out really early (5 weeks) because my period is like clockwork.
Well...used to be.
It was at the time.
I felt and saw it - it was kinda like something big going through me and then it was all over me.
"The size of my hand, literally."
"I was able to pick it up, move it, etc."
It's crazy to think about even now.
It still feels like yesterday sometimes.
He was so cute.
He did struggle in his cage but that's okay.
He was so happy to get off.
He was so cute.
I was so upset.
Once we got to the hotel I gave him a bath immediately.
He got so clean after that.
I was so mad at that little brat.
I don't know how brain dead you can be to drop a turtle but that was infuriating.
That is the last time I let a kid touch my pet turtle.
Poor guy.
Sorry lil buddy.
(I was worried about health effects for my boy!)
"But they had to check his box, and insisted on swabbing it for explosives."
Or maybe drugs?
"They found none, of course, except the ADDICTIVE AND EXPLOSIVELY CUTE personality of my turt."
The rest of the trip was less eventful.
It was only when the box was closed that he tried to dig his way to freedom.
This is going to be his home for years to come.
"He's hopefully never going to have to travel by plane again, and I think he's more than okay with that."
Big jump!
I wasn't gonna leave my son (Rocky the Turtle) behind.
Or drugs?
I guess he's just that HOT looking haha.
But really.
Rocky was NOT a fan of the box by the way.
He would shuffle around and try to dig his way into the paper towels I laid down for the trip whenever the box was closed.
"When it was open, however, he'd chill and peek his lil turtley head up and out, taking in the sights."
"This was only between planes, however."
Could not open the box and take him out midflight.
"Seemed risky, didn't want him getting loose and causing a panic, or even worse, getting hurt."
"He was tucked under the seat in front of me the entire flight, and all you could hear was occasional little flurries of scrapes as he tried to burrow his way out of the box to freedom."
I've always loved taking picture.
"As a teenager, you never saw me without my Nikon."
I was always in the photo lab at school.
Becoming a professional photographer was a life long dream for me.
To see MY picture.
Right there on the cover.
I could never have imagined it.
"But there it was, my picture on the cover of Time Magazine."
My name in the credits of Time freaking magazine!
The sky is the limit.
The future is bright.
I was very excited.
"When I first found out that one of my photos was going to be published, I was so excited and overjoyed that I cried happy tears and could not thank God, enough!"
This was a huge milestone for me as a professional photographer.
He was thrilled for me and gave me huge congratulations!
They were also very excited!
This made the event even more special.
When I got the magazine in the mail I was so happy!
The magazine was beautifully printed and I could not believe how gorgeous the portrait looked in it.
Everyone in the family was ecstatic!
This was a very joyous memory for me in my photography career and definitely a great memory.
This was very exciting and made me very happy!
I had been trying for a little while to get a portrait published and when it finally happened I couldn't have been more excited!
"I was so excited when I found out I just kept thanking God, and cried tears of joy!"
He was so excited and happy for me and was very supportive.
Everyone was very happy about the news and that was great!
When it came in I was brimming with excitement!
I was overjoyed when I opened the magazine and saw my portrait!
I couldn't believe how great it looked!
This was such an exciting time and great milestone as a photographer.
I skipped that day hoping the next day gonna be better.
"I went straight to see our family doctor fortunately, I met him on a good condition, He attended to me."
I explained to him exactly how i was feeling and from my explanation he could figure out what could be happening.
I felt so clear that i will be fine as my body was responding to treatment.
though out the week i took this medication so serious and after all i became better.
I was so surprise been so getting better so quick because something similar to this happen to someone i know that took him many month to get recover from it.
but my was so surprise and feel happy that i could get fit back again.
That fateful day in June - June Seventh 2019 was a day like any other ordinary day.
"It began the same, mid way also."
"This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain."
"It was intense, extreme, unbearable."
"It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing."
Was this very serious?
I contemplated my options all the while suffering.
Do I go to the ER?
A local Urgent Care?
I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain.
It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature.
Was it a spider bite?
So many things raced through my mind.
"This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected."
After the pain - The healing.
I worried - will I need to take more pain medicine?
"Wisdom Teeth come in around 17 years of age, or start to and eventually become impacted."
"Impaction leads to vision problems, pain, on site infection, and shifting teeth among other things."
"I have experienced some pain for years over this, but only recently, has it become so bad that it incapacitates me."
"While I personally do not want to undergo wisdom tooth extraction, I definitely recommend it if you suffer."
My boyfriend and I have been together for several years now.
I have been devastated.
My emotional roller coaster has been mostly down.
"I know that killing myself over a guy is stupid, but they continue to come."
I don't have any support in my life.
My boyfriend was my entire support system.
I am just so sad and alone right now.
I'm glad that I do not own a gun because that would have made it too easy to do it.
"I do not want to die, but I cannot imagine a life without him."
We have been going threw a lot of problems and even fighting with each other.
I am so upset i can manage i thought he loved me like no one else.
My only hope is that i can find myself again ive been struggling though everyday its a battle just to eveh eat food.
My class mate tells me dont worry about anything but just helping myself.
I dont know how people can just move on like that do they not feel as deeply as they show.
Have mercy on me have mercy on my soul.
I cannot forgive myself at least not yet i am trying and trying.
I want to be proud of myself and make the ones who came before me proud.
He still does not love me the same i see his face everyday and its still the same.
I feel like i am worthless and ugly and no one can ever love me.
How can i want to live with myself after all of this im just an embarrassment.
I have never felt more ugly in my life.
Hopefully i can just fins the strength to get over this i just want to forget about this whole thing.
Now i am going to try to regain my pothetic life and see were i left off.
I know one thing i am going to go for my music that is the only thing o have left now and i am slowly losing that.
My mind has been in and out im doubting myself more than ever i am just a loser.
What can i do who can help me i just need someone as a friend right now.
I can belive i came this low in this miserable life.
No one understands me everyone just wants to judge me.
"4 months ago i kept my baby boy seated on the floor of my living room, playing with his toys, i removed my eyes from him for about 2 minutes cause i need to reply tomy messages online."
i was so amazed and surprised.
"when this happened some thought came to my mind, that my baby could now begin to crawl."
"my baby will definitely entertain himself crawling on the floor, picking up his toys and from ther he will be able to stand holding something and before i know he will take his first step."
so i felt a great sigh of relief and i was so happy and proud of him.
"Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life."
"From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring."
But there’s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time.
Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby’s improvements.
"Of course, there’s completely nothing off-base with that!"
"In any case, it’s vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path."
Most babies begin to crawl somewhere between 6 and 10 months of age.
It was an awesome experience to watch him learn how to move on his own.
To be able to put him down and let him do his own thing was a welcome experience after several months of carrying him everywhere.
I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog.
It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills.
I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk.
That experience will present its own challenges and I look forward to facing those with him.
I love being with him and his personality shines as his abilities increase.
I can't wait to see the person that he becomes.
"Since last writing about this event, it has continued to progress and develop."
He is opening cabinets and drawers and taking things out to play with them.
He is quite a handful now.
I assume that his growth will continue to accelerate until we can't even keep up with him anymore.
I look forward to seeing him start to walk on his own.
I am also excited for his first word.
It will be great when we can communicate meaningfully with each other.
I also am looking forward to when he can hold a bottle up all by himself.
"I don't even think he really cares about this kind of thing, it's all for show."
But it's my brother!
"I love him, and I'm his best man!"
"Apparently I didn't screw anything up, though, so I guess I wasn't as messed up as a I felt."
"I was happy, but a little disappointed in him."
The wedding was being held several hours from where I lived.
It was in a  beautiful location.
The weather was very nice the whole time.
It was a lot of fun.
I felt very happy for my brother and his wife.
It was a lot of fun.
It was very lovely.
I really enjoyed it.
It was a lot of fun.
I could not believe that I had deal with this at this time.
I was not ready to handle this level of stress.
Just when things seems to be going right for once in my life.
Here this comes.
I am completely mentally and emotionally drained of the situation.
I thought I would have a grip.
i was wrong.
This is something that would never happen like this.
It was like she was almost destined to die this way.
THe hope that she would live was bad enough.
Now to cement this made this even more worst than it really was.
Hard to breathe right now.
I am going to go cry now.
"My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything."
"She lived with her grandson, who is 23."
He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life.
We went to visit her a few times in the hospital.
My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power.
She was not going to come back and be herself.
She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really.
"She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond."
She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken.
"It was sad that she died this way, and so soon."
"We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke."
"I then had to take over as executor of her trust which wasn't an easy task, and I had to inform people of her death and post on Facebook for her."
Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her.
She seemed to be handling treatment well.
"We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc."
So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water.
"It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away."
As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary).
I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney.
"Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well."
He still needs help accessing all of the resources she left him and after his power was shut off reached out for help.
"The surprises just don't end with this event, they just keep coming and coming and I pray they will settle down soon."
We were so excited for our son to have a sibling.
We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real for our son knowing he would have a little sister.
"Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it."
We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on.
"But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling."
I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy.
"It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy."
He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days.
"Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was."
"Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much."
He is super protective over her and it's a huge relief that they like each other now.
Today was the day!
I was so scared to go through another c-section.
At least this time it was planned and not an emergency.
I'm so tired but I'll never be able to sleep.
I can't get enough of that beautiful little face.
He didn't seem to be too happy when he met her.
"It could be because I'm not home too, change is always hard for a toddler."
Not even 24 hours old and she already has a sibling injury.
"I thought he was going to kiss her, but I was mistaken."
I'm going to have to make sure he gets enough attention.
My heart is so full.
I think being a mom is probably the best thing in the world.
I am worried about how hard it will be to have two little ones but I guess it will come with time.
I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.
"This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child."
"The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again."
This time was different.
"I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child."
I think my biggest concern was how my son was going to handle having a baby sister.
He was barely two.
I didn't know if he was going to be upset.
I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.
My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.
My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.
He stroked her hair and said 'baby'.
"Until the baby started screaming, that is."
"Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped."
I had expected him to be unsure of the new baby but I never expected him to do that.
I think that was the beginning of a lifelong sibling rivalry.
It was going to be the project that sent me into mega bucks.
I can't stand her but I need the break so I answer.
I clearly couldn't leave in the middle of this project.
"Yes, I kept my job, but at what cost."
My grandfather is dead.
I am here alone with my money.
"However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind."
This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home.
I loved my grandfather so much.
I was so close to him.
He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot.
We always had so much fun together.
In that time my grandfather was really fit and had no health issues whatsoever.
I had no words to say.
I got so panic and did not know what to do.
Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day.
I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him.
When I reached there I saw that everyone crying and hugging each other.
Is he okay?
When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend.
A friend that I used to share everything of my life.
That was a big loss of my life.
I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.
He was so close to me.
I used to share my happiness and sadness with him.
"However, when I left him, he was perfectly fine and was healthy as well."
He had no health issues whatsoever.
I was so impressed with his diet and the style that he lived his life.
I could not meet him in his last time.
I had wanted to go on vacation for a while.
It had been quite a bit of time since I had gone anywhere.
Colorado sounded nice.
I had never been there before.
When I got there I couldn't believe how beautiful it was.
Majestic was the only way to describe the land in this area.
So many beautiful sights to see.
I packed up my gear.
It is a great place.
I loved riding the rapids there.
I had so much fun.
It was truly an awe inspiring trip.
It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier.
"Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States."
It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains.
"Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids."
"While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid."
"My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also."
"She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park."
"After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it."
"It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time."
"None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting."
"My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter."
She was 'rescued' but soured for the rest of the ride.
"She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again."
"After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day."
"It was a very emotional time for me, but no so much for my kid!"
My baby is growning into an adult.
I'm sure it is hard for any parent.
It is a time of letting your child go out into the world.
I will try to stay positive.
I think a support system is very important.
"I told my son to keep in touch with me as much as possible, and I worry that he won't contact me as much as I want!"
I realize that he is an adult now so it is just something that I have to accept.
That will always be a precious memory in my mind.
Thinking of it helps me remember our strong relationship.
I know that I do not have to worry.
My son will be fine!
It was a very sad day.
we came back and visited for a while.
that afternoon we decided it was time for us to head back home.
i did not want to go.
he is my boy and i am going to miss him dearly.
this is good for him though.
"good for me, too."
i am so very proud of him.
he is going to be fine.
"i don't know if i will be, though."
he is my first born.
it will be good to hear his voice when he calls.
i don't know if i will be able to wait to hear from him.
it was fun packing him and getting him ready to go.
we had fun trying to decide what he should take and what he should leave.
We sang and talked and sang some more.
we had a good time.
Now it was time to organize and put things away in his apartment.
"This, also, was a fun time."
I could tell my son was excited to live on his own.
we decided the best layout for his room and his furniture.
I think we took longer than necessary to avoid goodbyes.
"once there was nothing left to do, sadness set in."
It was time to go.
I did not want to leave and my son did not want us to either.
he kept talking to us with a glimmer of tears in his eyes and I could tell he did not want us to leave but it was getting late and it was time.
It is very hard for a mom to leave her son behind to be on his own.
I go into the truck and waved until he was no longer in sight.
I cried most of the way home.
"It made sense after the fact, since it is income."
And the IRS can take almost all income you get.
I should have known.
I had previous years that I didn't declare too.
But going back over the forms and figured it out.
I four years to go back over.
Overall it wasn't that big of a deal too.
I was glad I could get installments to do it.
It helped me so I could actually repay the taxes.
The installments made it easy in a way.
I should have known that the patreon income would be taxed.
I just felt it was different in some way.
"I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable."
And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all.
I feared getting into serious trouble.
In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable.
"According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting."
"This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief."
I also subtract 15% self-employment tax.
"It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind."
"When I began getting my Patreon income, I assumed it was gift income."
So I assumed I didn't have to worry about taxes on it.
It was becoming the majority of my income.
So I continued to worry that it was taxable.
I was worried about the amount of past income I might owe back taxes on.
It was fairly easy to make monthly installment arrangements that I could afford.
And my monthly income was within the personal exemption amount.
So my worst fears weren't realized.
I could survive the payments I had to make.
It's really hard to believe.
There was a time in my life when I didn't think I would ever want to have kids.
"I mean, they're just so sticky and smelly and...they just seem like work."
"Maybe I'm ready for my life to mean something more than...to be about something more than just me, just getting through, just going from one moment to the next."
"What it looks like, what's going to happen after I'm gone."
"I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter."
Who are they going to be?
Where are they going to end up?
How will they change the world.
"I keep think too about the past, all the people before me who were once children, were once babies growing inside someone's stomach."
"It makes me dizzy, like looking up at the stars from the top of the mountain--how they just keep going and going."
"It scares me too, makes me afraid for this little life I'm going to bring into the world."
How can I keep them safe?
"But I'm excited, I'm determined, to make the most of this gift."
"I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA."
So the timing is a little hectic.
"I have been a single mother for years and felt no need to settle, so I was planning on adopting in the next few years."
"I've also worked very hard on my fitness the past 2 years, and this plan felt perfect so I wouldn't have to give up the progress on my body."
I'd even told him not to expect me to have kids if he wanted to be with me.
"At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy."
"It's been a huge adjustment, however."
"Being an only child, my personal space is very important to me."
"I understand some sacrifices are necessary though, and in the end it will definitely be worth it."
I am progressing smoothly.
"I'm 33, so my body isn't too young anymore."
"I have a lot more energy, and feel almost normal."
We had a blast.
"He is very excited about the pregnancy too, as he is an only child."
"Either way though, it's a blessing."
"I really never planned on having anymore children, although I thought about maybe adopting."
I am very driven and focused on building a career though.
So I just didn't think that this would be feasible.
"He's not only stepped up for household duties, but also as a father figure to my son."
I couldn't be any happier with how my life is currently going.
"I never would've dreamt it would be possible to have it all, but here I am living beyond my wildest dreams!"
I ended up helping.
The decor was already bought.
"Mainly, the help needed was to just put up all the decor."
It involved many ladders and tape.
We got it done in time and it looked good.
Many of us didn't like the chosen decor but it wasn't our call.
The candles needed to be blown out quickly so they wouldn't burn the cake.
I think is was because they were so close together.
Nothing bad happened.
Good food and friends.
We celebrated it at my house.
We had put so many candles on the birthday cake that the flames started to merge into one.
"The birthday person had to blow out the candles quickly, otherwise the flames might have reached the cake!"
It took a while for them to blow out all the candles.
We enjoyed eating the cake and talking about things at the party.
We had things like champagne and small chocolate morsels.
I remember enjoying the party a lot.
The cake was big and very flavorful.
It was made of chocolate and vanilla.
It was a nice setup.
Soon we lit the candles.
"There were many candles on the cake, because they looked good on the type of cake that I had bought."
The flames had joined each other into sort of a bonfire like appearance.
It was funny but somewhat dangerous.
My family member had to blow them out quickly before the whole cake burned up!
My family enjoyed the party.
It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.
I told the staff to watch out he may be using in the bathroom.
He was out in the bathroom stall but still breathing.
I actually know the guy kinda which is weird well I have seen him a few times.
He was taken to treatment hopefully he sticks with it but it is very doubtful.
It is one of the problems with liberal cities.
They totally allow people to use drugs anywhere and sometimes even help them inject in some cities.
In every bathroom in portland there is a used needle trash can.
I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.
I hope that guy is ok and figures things out but that is doubtful he will be dead in a year at the rate he is going.
My cousins parents from my dad's siblings never got divorced.
I just felt that my life and relationship with my dad was very different than my cousins and they don't understand what it is like when parents get divorced and how kids can be treated because of it.
I feel cheated in that respect and felt envious that they had normal childhoods and good relationships with their parents.
He is not going to be around much longer and I wish things had been different between us but I don't think it was all my fault .
I think that will probably be our last family reunion .
I am glad I got to see everyone and we had a great time.
But it is also sad that it probably won't happen again .
Not much you can do but accept things as they are and not dwell on them.
I asked what they wanted me to bring and they told some things I could bring.
I asked them why were they doing it because I thought maybe my dad was sick and nobody informed me of it.
He is turning ninety this year .
"The one cousin I asked said just to come in, I think."
So it kind of worried me  that something might be wrong with him.
There was no one left on my dad's side but him.
All his brothers and sisters and their spouses were dead.
One of my cousins was a photographer and we went outside and took a lot of outdoor pictures of everyone and later he put them online for us.
"It was good to see everyone and it felt like when we were all kids and were at our grandparents house eating her food and seeing each other, like at Christmas or Thanksgiving."
Most of them brought the food that grandma made when we were growing up so that made it feel even more like a family reunion .
It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us.
He teared up some and I think everyone else did too.
It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long.
It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.
Some of them have to fly in so not sure how many will make it.
I will go to that event since it is only an hour and a half away from me and an easy drive.
"Moving away from my hometown was a crazy change, and it's hard to believe I actually went through with it."
Most people don't.
Ultimately though I was just too bored in my hometown.
Seeing the same friends at the same places while drinking and eating the same things just grows so tiresome.
At least for me anyway.
"It was my snoozefest of a desk job that forced me to pack up and head across the country for a new life, but the dull familiarity of the area was a big reason too."
I needed a change in the worst way.
I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too.
"But it's new and it's fresh, and that's the significant part."
"I have a whole new area to explore here out west, and the weather here makes back home feel like Russia."
"In a way I don't want them out here, but I would certainly like to see them eventually."
"This new life has the potential to really let me grow in ways that I never could back home, so I'm just pumped about getting to blaze my own trail at this point in my life."
Her name was Debbie.
I found and find her very attractive still.
"When I got back up north, I still played in my mind the idea of moving down to Daytona Beach."
"My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio."
"But, I plan to now make this my home and see what happens."
She was/is very beautiful and very nice.
"The weather would be perfect, the ocean was near, and the chance for romance spurned me on."
"As good as I planned this trip from January to July, everything convinced me that this was a great move for me."
"And I gave, sold, or left behind all my furniture as I was just moving myself and my 2 cats down to Florida in my car."
Just some few momentos and my clothes were all I took.
And then things got worse.........
Talk about being floored!
(This after  talking to her for over 2 years over the phone.
"I have no furniture, and very little money to try and furnish it and to get by."
"She had been involved with her fiance for quite a while, and I always knew they should be together."
It went well and was very cute.
They both liked the same colors and everything was beautiful.
All her friends from the past were part of the ceremony and it was quite uplifting.
They had original plans to do a lot more and spend more time on ceremony type things.
So the main focus was on food and games.
Not so much the formal aspects.
They had so much food to choose from.
It was quite entertaining the different choices they had.
So much variety in foods.
It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles.
Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.
It was a simple affair in the backyard of a friend's house.
She was marrying her girlfriend of 5 years.
My parents were there as well as my dad's sisters.
Also in attendance were her girlfriend's family and friends.
The service was lovely.
Both brides tried to hold back tears of joy as they gave their vows.
Everything was cooked by various guests of the wedding.
The best food served was the burnt ends brought by my dad.
The barbecue on them tasted great and the meat was so soft and chewy.
It really felt like it came from a professional.
"Overall, it was a very fun experience."
I believe those 2 will be together for the rest of their lives.
They are perfect for each other.
It took place on a breezy and cool May afternoon.
There were tears shed as they gave their vows.
I was able to enjoy some of the best burnt ends I had ever had.
The wedding cake also tasted great.
It was was made by one of the brides who has great cooking skills.
"As for the women, they are very happy right now."
They also love each other very much.
Their relationship feels like a template and a good example to follow.
They get along very well and are able to communicate.
They also play well off each other in conversations.
Overall I'm happy that they found each other.
I hope I'm able to find something like that in my future.
A lot of them were just really intrigued by the whole process of growing a garden.
I really have to say it intrigued me too.
"I think its nice to come together with people who you assume are different than you are, and realize that no, its not that way at all."
You also find out you like similar things.
"They are low income people, and I even hate that term now, they are just people to me now, and I am just glad we were able to help them."
I think it was just something that needed to happen for me to wake up a little bit.
"This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me."
"Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well."
"Now that I know more about that, and how it can bring people together, I am really intrigued by it."
"Its something that is a process, but at the same time it is also peaceful."
"It made those people happy, and it did me as well."
This was something that I am just glad I got to experience with people who really ended up making me happy in the end as well.
I look forward to helping more when I can.
"It's a program that provides plants, seeds, dirt and containers with dirt for portable gardens for low income people."
I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there.
I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden.
When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready.
The event was way more than I expected.
We had over 100 people show up.
"They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them."
They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow.
The best part about it was the kids that came.
Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden.
It was encouraging to see.
"Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that."
Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults.
It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store.
I don't really know how all these gardens we gave away turned out.
"I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today."
And I'm hopeful  that down the line we helped raise some future gardeners whose life will be better because of it.
The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come.
It will be interesting to see if people return and maybe even have stories to tell or pictures of their successful gardens!
We provide beginner gardens for low income people so they can grow their own vegetables.
We give them dirt and plants and seeds to get started.
We even provide containers for them if they don't have a yard to plant in.
It's fun to see how excited the children are to be able to pick plants that they want.
"The lady that runs it says we're helping the next generation rise out of poverty by giving them the skills to do different things that can better their lives, like growing healthy food."
Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids.
Each year it's a different seed.
My favorite part of the giveaway this year was the look on the little boy's face who won for biggest plant!
He was so proud.
It's moments like that that touch me the most.
How easy it is to make a child feel special and proud of themselves.
The doctors really didn't think she could live safely at home.
I am really devastated about this all happening so fast.
I still feel like I should be able to contact her anytime.
I sometimes wonder if I just speak into the sky if she will hear me.
I really should know better.
I have never believed in that stuff.
I am really glad they are all able to lean on each other.
I am happy I have my boyfriend and my son to help me keep my mind off of it.
My mother  had been living in a nursing home.
"They were afraid that due to her age, she was not strong enough and that caused her to fall."
I was devasted because I had really hoped she would come.
She continued to work as hard as was possible at the time.
"During  her time there, though, I was relieved because I knew she was safe."
"It happened so quickly, that I had no chance to help her or slow her fall."
"I knew that at some point, she would break a bone."
She broke a bone in her wrist when  I wasn't there.
I hoped it would help strengthen her.
"I also hoped that the rehab center would be able to convince her to use her walker, as I had been unable to do."
I had hoped that she would be able to come home again.
All the family was there some of which I hadn't seen  in a really long time.
It was great catching up on all the family news and drama.
Everybody was in a good mood and were having fun.
There wasn't one thing on the menu that she had ordered.
"She finally got over it and the fun started, the food turned out to be very tasty so all ended well."
We danced until we were bone tired.
The band was excellent and everybody said they enjoyed the music.
We all stood outside and watch them drive away waving and cheering.
It was nice going and seeing family members I hadn't seen in a long time.
"Some of my cousins live in England, so it was great to see them and catch up."
It was well put together and emotional.
"Once it got dark the heat wasn't so bad, and at least the portable bathrooms they provided were air conditioned."
It was only an hour away from where I live too so it was an easy drive back and forth.
"They offered hotels for any guests who wanted to stay the night, but I'd rather sleep in my own bed."
It was definitely a memorable night.
I don't get out to the country often.
This was a while ago now.
I may not remember as many details.
"Since there were no trees around, it was nice and quiet and quite beautiful."
"The bathrooms were in a trailer that was air conditioned, so that was nice."
"I was able to see family from Chicago, England, LA, and other places I don't normally get to see."
It was fun watching my dad have to squirm while he interacted with brothers he doesn't particularly care for.
In the end it all worked out.
"The ceremony was nice, and my cousin looked beautiful in her dress."
"I felt like I was sweating too much due to the heat, and the pictures I'm in I don't look too good in."
But I understand they were very busy that day and had a lot of guests to interact with.
Overall I had a very good time at the wedding.
"Mostly squirrels at first and a few deer, and one tiny humming bird."
I was out misting the peonies and the bird kept flitting in and out of the hose.
Eventually i got a chair and just sat spraying the mist and letting the bird flutter around.
They are incredibly beautiful creatures and also very small.
I worried i might get it too wet to fly but that didnt happen.
I was happy the bird was there and it seemed happy to be getting misted.
It was a wonderful moment of man and nature coming together.
So far i havent seen him but i will remember the simple joy i got that morning.
I am glad i could provide for nature and enjoy moments like that.
I hope everyone can take some time to enjoy the little things in life.
It was about a month ago during a rather warm July morning.
"I was feel kind of low due to not seeing many of my friends anymore due to everyone being busy with their own schedule, and work being a little slow was also on my mind."
"I may have been feeling sorry for myself, but the wounds were real."
"At first I thought he was just doing his early morning pollen rituals, but to my surprise he wanted water."
The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose.
I turned down the pressure of the hose to a fine mist and pointed the mist into the direction of the humming bird .
The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time.
If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream.
It was great the bird had no fear of animosity of a human.
He knew there was a human controlling the hose and he did not care he wanted water on this warm summer day.
"I felt great, I felt a connection with this little bird, we at this brief aquatic encounter were friends."
It seemed that God saw my loneliness and sent me a friend.
That small communal moment with nature make me feel better for the rest of the day.
I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.
I was felling a little low due to work being a little slow.
It was darting in and out of the hose water stream.
The hummingbird loved this.
"It was no afraid of me, it liked the water."
It took its fill by drinking and cooling off its shiny feathers on a hot summer morning.
the humming bird took to flight after it has its fill.
I felt closer to nature that morning.
I felt that humans and animals can work together and help each other out.
It was a good morning.
I still thing about my brief time being close with a hummingbird.
"Because the family is kind of spread out around the country, we don't get to see each other as often as we would like."
We decided to drive down instead of flying so we could make it into more of a road trip.
I found that part of it to be very relaxing.
Seeing all of the sites along the way was a great experience.
When we finally arrived in Miami we immediately set out to get the surprise party worked out.
It really paid off.
There were three different cakes and each one was more delicious than the last.
The chocolate cake was my personal favorite.
"The entire night, you couldn't pry the smile off of my sister's face."
She was talking a mile a minute and was just beaming the whole time.
"Overall, it was a great trip for us and the family as well."
We celebrated my sister's 74 birthday.
We had a great time with all of them.
We toured a lighthouse.
We had some great food.
We had a low country boil in honor of my sister's birthday.
We had some great fried rice.
The traffic was bad coming home.
If they didn't live in such a hot area of the country we might move there.
We enjoyed being with them a lot.
Maybe we will go back next year.
Or maybe we should plan a trip for Dec. when the new baby is born.
It was a long drive and we stopped some place about 2 hours away for the night.
"We arrived right at lunchtime, but my sister and husband hadn't gotten there yet."
They were coming from just across the state.
They were restructuring and he was being laid off.
But they weren't too concerned about that.
We had a great time with everyone that evening.
On Sat.
night leftovers.
When we returned the problem was fixed.
It was a great few days and I'm looking forward to going again.
I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.
I'm such a procrastinator!
"I almost didn't answer it because I was driving and all that, but my best friend fished it out of the abyss for me."
I am SO glad I took the call!
"They have a web page where you can enter-for-a-chance-to-win stuff like T-shirts, concert tickets and vacations (obviously)."
"I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests."
"I was so excited when I got that call, having never been to Las Vegas, that I immediately called the radio station."
I almost thought it wasn't real.
The lady who answered the phone assured me that if I had gotten the automated call I had definitely won the trip.
"She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold."
"This excited me even more, because I've always wanted to go to Mexico."
It was the most amazing trip and I will forever remember it!
I was very excited as I was going to see my favorite singer with one of my closest friends I do not see often.
I had 10 minutes to call in and claim the trip.
"The trip for scheduled for the upcoming winter, what perfect timing."
I was extremely excited as I won a trip and was seeing my favorite singer all in the same day.
"That was easy, my girlfriend."
We hadn't been dating that long but I knew she was the perfect choice.
The concert was a blast as was the trip to Mexico.
It was a day I'll never forget.
I was with a few of my friends.
My spouse was home with the kids.
"I have always put my name in drawing for things, even though I have never won anything."
"I at first thought it was a prank, but i called anyway."
What was the worst thing that could happen.
They say i did not win?
Both me and my spouse love Vegas.
"We enjoy the people watching, lights, hot weather, and gambling (even though we never win)."
I could not believe it.
I was so excited to have won this.
I even joke to my spouse that this was the greatest day of my life.
I usually get the side eye from that.
"I am always reminded about the birth of our children, wedding, and engagement proposal."
"Either way it was a great night, and a great trip a few weeks later."
I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more.
I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat.
This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure.
"It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away."
"At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different."
We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours.
My stomach was feeling a little bit queasy and I was hoping it wasn't the berries I ate from earlier!
It has been an eye opening experience.
I had no idea that there was so much food all around us that we simply pass by every day.
It really opened my eyes and showed me something new.
There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities.
There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters.
I have grown alot since I woke up to all this.
It has been a great experience.
I would not trade what I learned for anything.
Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it.
I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too.
I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features.
"I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants."
This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery.
It's amazing to see something all around you that was always there but you never saw before.
I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.
I went with several family member.
We decided to hike the top of Mt. Leconte.
It was a fun experience.
My father got some brown boots and brown pants for the hike.
My mother dressed in all black.
My brothers and sisters decided to dress in all white.
It was a big adventure.
My brother slipped in the middle of the hike.
I thought he might of gotten injured.
He only got a small scrape and we continued on.
It was a feast of some chicken and apple pies.
Leconte in the Smoky Mountain National Park.
She had had knee surgery in the past and was unable to make it to the top due to her knee pain.
WE were determined we were going to make it this time.
WE started at around 8:00 am that morning.
Two of our party did not make it to the top but tried their best.
"Of the ones who made it, it took us 4 hours to make it all the way to the top."
We were exahausted but elated we had reached our goal!
The way down didn't take nearly as long because it was mostly down hill.
It took about 2 and a half hours to make the journey back to our car.
On our way back down we met up with the two in our party who did not make it to the top although they had made great progress.
They were disappointed and vowed to make it to the top the next time we went.
I really enjoyed our hiking expeirence although it was very taxing.
I would love to try again in the future and see if we can make it to the top faster the next time.
Leconte via Alum Trail.
It's an 11 mile round trip hike with a 16.53 trail rating which is considered strenuous.
"We started of on our hike with myself, my sister, brother, husband, daughter, niece and brother in law."
My daughter who has had knee surgery was next to go down and my husband stayed back with her.
We ended up only going to he top of the Alum Cave trail because it was another 5.5 miles to the top and we couldn't not in good conciense make our hiking companions wait on us to complete the entire hike.
Fast foward two years later.
My hiking companions this time are the same minus my daughter.
We had not been hiking as much this year and are not in as good a shape as we were on our last attempt.
The path is much more strenuous this time and by the time we make it to Alum cave we are wiped but determined to continue.
"We are already down one hiking companion, my brother in law, but he told us to go on without him."
"As we continue myself, niece and husband pull away from my sister and brother."
As they continue it becomes to strenous for my brother and he has to abandon the hike.
My sister ends up catching up with us as I have really slowed down as it is a straight up hike now.
We are all struggling but are dertemined to make it to the top.
As we head down we meet up with my brother first who was not faring well he had run out of water.
We share our water and continue down.
As we near the bottom we see my brother in law waiting for us.
We have decided to return in a couple years and see if we can all make it to the top.
We had a wonderful time!
There were so many things to do and it was great spending time with my family.
We made so many happy memories!
My aunt got her jewelry back and when we got to the port they put the man off the boat.
I was surprised that we were able to put it behind us and have fun.
It's amazing how quickly she forgave the whole incident.
It really was great!
We left Barcelona for a one-week Mediterranean cruise.
It was great to see the whole family and be together.
"We all live in different parts of the country, so it is rare that we are all together at one time."
We had a lot of fun with nieces and nephews who are growing up quickly.
She was so excited and happy to go with us.
I will remember that moment.
There were a lot of downsides to the cruise.
contributed to a somewhat negative experience.
"However, many positive things will help to keep the memory happy."
There were 12 of us who traveled together.
"The cruise was for my in-laws 55th anniversary, so they took the whole family."
We spent the night there before boarding the ship.
"The cruise lasted for one week and included stops in Spain, France, and Italy."
"The buses we took for excursions had very little air conditioning, making the trips miserably hot."
"In general, we had fun, however the days were very long and tiring."
"We had many food allergies in the group, and they did not do a good job accommodating."
"I've been on other cruises where they over accommodated for allergies, but this ship did not meet those expectations."
"All-in-all, I'm happy I had this experience and I saw a lot of places I would want to visit again."
"However, I do not have a desire to go on the particular cruise or cruise line again."
He was a vision compared to his other classmates.
"He looked at me and winked with a glimmer in his eyes, a look that said it all."
The long hours of studying all these years have finally paid off and he is finally graduating.
The road up until here was not an easy one but we made it.
The graduation ceremony took place in the arena in the city and was as grand as you could imagine.
The arena was prepared for a prestigeous ceremony with attendees from prestigeous educational backgrounds.
It really was a day to remember.
he took his degree and proudly walked back to his seat.
This is what we had all been waiting for all these years.
The celebration of achievement is a celebration like no other.
I hope that every parent gets to feel this feeling of pride and love of their childs achievements.
He was graduating from college and it was a very special trip for me.
The ceremony was held in a huge auditorium in the middle of downtown.
"The whole time, he looked like an ant to me and I really couldn't see him."
"Luckily, I was located above the exit that the graduates were filing out of."
"At the very end of the night, the most wonderful thing happened."
We locked eyes and I have never seen him so proud and happy.
It was our own special moment.
That look is something I will never forget.
"Every time I think of that night and the pride and happiness for him that I have, the look in his eyes at that moment is the first thing that pops into my head."
I can precisely picture everything about my surroundings that night.
I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture.
"This night, however, I can clearly recall the view across the room, the colors, the sounds, the whole entirety of it all, and most importantly, the feelings."
I know I could go back to that huge room and find the seat I was sitting in among thousands just based on the clarity of my memory.
I took everything in.
I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available.
"At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not."
He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was.
"Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away."
"In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant."
"The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt."
"In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night."
"Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me."
"With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes."
I will never forget the look he had on his face.
"It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility."
Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared.
"Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words."
And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky.
"They were flying in V formation like geese - dark, deadly, shrieking metal geese."
"They flew toward the river, and beyond, leaving everybody shaken, overwhelmed and very surprised."
Why would they fly like that over a peaceful city like ours?
Where were they going?
And what were they going to do out there?
"In that instant, I didn't feel scared for myself or my community, but I felt horrified by the sheer amount of brute force and power displayed."
"I thought of people living in cities being bombed by similar planes, the horror of it, and the powerlessness of those people."
"And for the first time, I physically felt what war is, I felt it in my bones, its monstrosity, and what it did to people."
Today was a sunny day.
it feel little bit cool as summer almost over.
it is time just pass 9 am.
people was jogging and walking on my way.
I looked up to the sky.
People was taking picture on it.
I was too late to take my picture.
I wonder if it is preparing an event for Labor day.
"After that I kept looking at sky,  think it may be had more jets will fly though."
I could have a chance to take a picture.
"however, it didn't happen."
"Sometime, you can't expecting a thing happen twice if you don't know what it from."
It was a lovely morning.
There is other people around too.
I looked up to the sky.
their are flying in V form above the river .
People were taking picture from their cell phone.
"When I took out my cell phone, I want to take some picture, the jets are all out of scene."
That flied to south.
It was too late for me.
After that people was back to their thing again.
I am continuous my walking.
This was a surprising event happen in a normal day.
It came with a little excitement from my daily life.
I will get my cell phone ready next time.
"I’ve always liked doing something charitable, and that Easter was just another time to give to those in need."
"We were just going to drop off some canned goods and a few baked goods my wife baked, but my daughter took it one step further."
Bless her heart.
"I know people say that teenagers only care for themselves, but she’s such a good girl."
"So, we did exactly that."
"I couldn’t believe the affect that such a simple, inexpensive gesture would have on these folks."
"I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other."
"I couldn’t thank my daughter enough for reminding me of this lesson, something so simple that I truly forgot it."
It took the little bit of compassion from a teenager to remind me why I do these kinds of things.
And they say teenagers only care about themselves… She’s a good egg.
"A few months ago, our Saturday fell on the day before Easter."
I wanted to do something special for the homeless.
"Frustrated, I suggested that she come up with some ideas, then."
Delight and happiness lit up the faces of the homeless as they found their 'surprises.
She tried not to let me or my husband see.
But we did.
I wanted to do something special for the homeless.
I made a few suggestions to my family.
She didn't return downstairs.
I assumed she just didn't want to do anything.
She suggested we fill plastic eggs with chocolates and deliver them with food to the homeless.
"She didn't want us to see, but we did."
I was very proud of her.
I shared a beer with my father.
I won the game and celebrated my win with some cake.
I still had a ton of fun at the reunion.
I went home with some great memories of the event.
It was a great time.
It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey.
"Last year, he came and picked up me and my partner at our place in New York and drove us there."
"This time, although one of the cousin's organizing the event said she'd try to arrange transportation, she was unable to do so, so we took the bus."
"This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up."
The whole trip should have take a couple of hours.
"I looked at Google Maps before leaving the house, and planned our route."
We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app.
"On the way to the bus, I called my cousin to confirm that we were on our way."
"When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved, and figured we see everyone in about an hour's time."
She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan.
"So, I made it and did not tell her."
"Her husband, who is Cuban, pronounced it 'Tremendo!'"
I felt the long trip had been worth the effort.
It was held at the home of my cousin Denise's former husband.
"To get there, my partner and I had to travel from our home in the Bronx to Manhattan."
We did this by subway.
Then we had to take a bus to New Jersey.
What did turn out nicely was our food contribution.
"My cousin Charlotte, who lives in Massachusetts, had mentioned in passing that she loves coconut flan."
"Therefore, I made that to bring to the reunion."
We did not tell her that that's what we were bringing.
"It came out really well, and she loved did, as did her Cuban-born husband."
I felt the whole long boring trip was worth the effort when I saw how happy it made her that I had thought of her and made one of her favorite dishes.
"I work for Walmart, a company I have been working for the past 3 years."
"This promotion I had been waiting and hoping for, for the last year."
I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines.
"At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did."
"I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager."
I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before.
"I like to do well in the goals and tasks that I have set for myself on a daily basis when it comes to my job, or anything that I do."
I am very grateful for this opportunity to be in this new position and so grateful to my employers above me that felt that I deserved this opportunity and are wanting me to progress and grow along side the company.
I have put so much time and effort into this place and it's starting to pay off.
"I know that if I put in the amount of hours, work, and dedication that I can achieve anything and for that I am so proud and honor to be apart of this establishment."
"I was supposed to be promoted in September of 2019, but instead, I was promoted starting in July of 2019."
I was so proud when I heard about my promotion.
"I have never been promoted in any job before, let alone earlier than normal."
It was a normal day when it first happened.
"Honestly, I was kind of scared as I didn't know what to expect."
I think I thought that maybe I didn't do a case right or my numbers weren't as good as they could have been.
I love my job.
"I also love that I was able to get promoted so early, and I also heard that nobody in a long time has been promoted early like I have."
Everyone was proud of me.
Even people I don't really talk to that much.
I have loved my promotion.
"Although I am held to higher standards now, I receive more money."
"It isn't just about the money, though, because I also am looked at with more esteem as well."
It feels truly incredible.
I love working at my job.
"The only negative aspect is that now since I'm held to higher standards, making mistakes is seen as worse than if I made a mistake in my older position."
"I have now been at the job for 11 months, and will be celebrating my 1 year anniversary next month."
I can't wait to spend more time at this job.
"They treat me well, and I have a lot of security here."
Everyone is so proud of me.
"Even my mom, as well as my wife are so proud."
It feels so good to live right now.
I was having a good time that day I ended up going out to eat twice and I went shopping a few times as well.
I normally would never drink as early as I did on my birthday.
It was during my last trip to the store that night.
I knew this person back from college days at the university.
Had a decent amount of time together.
we were pretty good friends during that time but it's been years since then.
we didn't date or anything but we were close.
we had a nice little conversation at the time we met at target.
after all was said and done we hugged and talked some more and eventually came to the decision that we would talk to each other again.
I was convinced that it was a bad idea then but it turned out to be quite alright.
There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.
"During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up."
"Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out."
I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.
"For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything."
"It would probably turn out to be a mistake but realistically, even through all of the rough patches, she was the only one that really made sense to me."
Everyone else wanted some sort of refreshments so they agreed to stop as well.
I find myself heading towards electronics as usual to browse.
"A bit after I'm browsing, I realize I need something near sporting goods."
It was my ex girlfriend that I'd known for over a decade.
"She looked different, like the happiness had been sucked out of her."
"She looked tired, really tired and I wondered how she'd been."
She didn't explode with excitement or even move.
"Quizzically, she just said my name again."
We hugged for what seemed like 10 minutes and then we finally broke apart and began to catch up.
I tried to keep everything casual but on the inside I felt a bit bad for her and missed her.
"By the end of it all, I couldn't help but to feel a bit bad but I was happy to have seen her."
We promised to keep in touch and then parted ways again.
I've been dealing with a lot lately.
If it wasn't for her I'd have to stay home to help my wife with daily activities.
My daughter has been helping out so much I hope her grades don't suffer because of it.
It was hard to watch while i was in the room with her.
"However, it is good to know what the problem was."
Only recently have things approximated the old days.
"However, the PCP needed to send her for a referral for her MRI test."
"Then, after we put pressure on them they approved."
"She had her scan, and the doctor sent her to another place for the back evaluation."
"After many trips and different places, she was able to get around a little bit."
"It is still not fixed, as she cannot get approved for a survery, even though they see the problem."
"Her therapy appointments are used up, too."
"So, she is back on just resting on meds."
This was the home of my dreams!
"I had done it, I had gone through all of the things I needed to do to get to this point in life, too."
I made myself proud and others as well.
It was a long and gruelly process but sometimes the things that take the longest to transpire are worth the wait.
His name is Pete.
Somehow we lost contact.
"He and I went to High School together, when we met again he told me about a house that was up for sale after meeting him again in a grocery store."
He only lived about two blocks away.
Since then we have gotten together a few more times and plan to date again.
"Now I can truly say I am happy with what I have chosen, and this house will be mine to live in for the rest of my life."
Not only that but I have rekindled a good friendship that might turn out to be something more.
This is what intriques me about life in general.
What a day!
The process was a long and drawn out one but so worth it in the end.
I looked at house after house after house and finally settled on the perfect one for me.
I started the process months before I actually purchased.
It took a long time finding a home because I am so indecisive and I didn't want to make a mistake and buy something I would hate in the future.
This caused me to want to see any and everything that was available.
Even after I thought I had seen it as I contemplated which house to purchase I couldn't decide.
It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home.
I was in love with the house and put in an offer immediately.
I don't want to live anywhere else.
"Although this was a daunting task, I wouldn't change how it all played out."
This was a long and sometimes painful process but a good experience nonetheless.
I viewed tons of homes and could not find the one for me.
I searched and searched and just couldn't find that one that stood out from the rest.
"Finally, after what felt like an eternity of searching I was ready to give up."
I was exhausted from searching and just didn't want to do it anymore.
It was perfect for me.
There were a few things that needed to be done and a few things that needed updating but the house was exactly what I was looking for.
This experience taught me to never give up.
I couldn't have been happier.
It was a long time coming.
"Finally, my house hunting journey was over."
I have been living in this home ever since and I love it.
This was five months ago and wow!
It's been quite a ride!
I have never lived this far away from my family so it's been scary and hard not having them here to support me.
At my age I didn't realize how much I still needed my m'om!
"I think I might get a cat from the shelter to keep me company, i spend so much time at the office that I don't have a ton of time alone."
It's mainly on weekends when I would be out with friends or having dinner with my parents.
I love my new job even though it's so fast paced.
I feel like I'm making an impact already.
I should be able to move from my apartment into a house within the next two years.
I'm glad I took the promotion even though it required that I move.
And I am flirting with my cute neighbor and think he's going to ask me out..
It was intimidating to be chosen for this opportunity but I felt ready.
I have been with the company for twelve years but this was still a shock.
I spent some time reviewing numbers and practices my answers.
I do not know anyone in the new city and would be away from family.
I did not have time to visit the city before I moved and found an apartment online.
The process was fast and made me nervous put I was glad it happened.
I looked at the process as a challenge but also a reward for my hard work.
"I am currently still in the position and live in the new city, which means I think about it all the time."
Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I stayed but I try not to go that way.
There is too much pressure and I feel like I am failing.
I see others do much better than me and take on more responsibility.
I want to do well but I don't know if I can do it.
Anytime that I feel like I am making progress there are more steps back.
More of what I want to do seems out of reach.
I am afraid that it was a mistake.
My life back home was easier.
It was easier to do the same thing again and again.
It was easier to have the same places to go and not be too concerned about what to do next.
I would like an easier job.
I am not sure if it was worth it but I am here now.
I cannot change the past and I need to move forward.
The was is not what I expected.
We have been married for ten years now.
He was the best man I have ever met.
We have been planning for weeks.
I got a nice hall and got a decorator to make it colorful.
He assisted with the cookies I was making.
I already negotiated with a restaurant to supply us a nice meal.
The elderly ones holding their spouse and swinging to all directions slowly.
The younger ones eyeing each other and making advances.
We watched from a corner as everything was unfolding.
I was greatly overwhelmed by how awesome he has been in our first ten years together.
We wanted to do something special to commemorate our love and devotion.
It is a romantic town with personality and history.
We thought it would be fitting for our relationship.
It was a romantic weekend of love and memories.
We had 40 guests from all over the country.
Everyone had a blast spending time together.
Our actual renewal ceremony was lovely.
I wore a white dress and our kids were in the bridal party.
There were beautiful floral arrangements and a huge vanilla cake.
I was thrilled to have our children present to partake in the family love.
"Our love, bond, and loyalty has only grown with every year of new adventures and exciting times."
"We have had ups and downs, high and lows, ebbs and flows."
The good times have made our love deepen and the hard times have only made us stronger.
We have two beautiful children that have completed our family and our lives.
"We have supported each other through jobs, stresses, monumental events, family deaths, etc."
We were proud of our journey and relationship and wanted to celebrate the enormous milestone of ten years of a healthy and happy marriage.
"We wanted it to be a joyous occasion marked by love, fun, dancing, food, and great memories."
We invited friends and family from all over the country to join us for dinner and dancing.
It was a lovely weekend that everyone is still talking about!
I wore a gorgeous dress and my husband looked handsome in his tuxedo.
Our children attended and got to share in the love of our marriage.
We made amazing memories that we will never forget.
"Most importantly, we remembered how and why we have lasted ten years and made a promise to last another ten and beyond."
What a place this turned out to be.
It was everything that I envisioned the natural beauty of this planet could be.
"We journeyed West, as our forefathers were one to."
The park wasn't the only place.
"There were several places on the way that we had seen, but none had made the impact like Bad Lands did."
The only thing bad about it was the name.
It was beautiful.
It's almost overwhelming how much there was to view.
But it was so special.
I felt like I was connected to everything and everyone.
My family seemed to enjoy it as well.
Not everything is about technology.
It's good to stay grounded.
We visited many different tourist destinations.
"Yellowstone National Forest, Mount Rushmore, and a wildlife park to name a few."
"This event was particularly special to me, because I have wanted to visit this park since I Was a little girl."
"A teacher shared pictures of her own vacation with me, and from that moment on, I have wanted to visit."
My visit was everything I have always imagined and more!
"The sun was so hot that day, but there was a nice breeze over the prairie."
This park was one of the things we did that all ages enjoyed.
My parents and children were equally impressed with the land formations and animals.
I plan to return on my next visit out West.
"I think the reason we all enjoyed it so much is because it was something that my parents, myself, and my young children all could enjoy together."
"The beauty was amazing, and he wildlife and natural land forms were something so very different than we had ever experienced before."
The sheer size of the creatures is what stands out in my memory to this day.
"My children still talk about the bison, and we have included studying these animals during our homeschooling days."
"The wildlife that my children probably enjoyed the most were the prairie dogs, as they were able to get fairly close to them!"
"The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing."
It was like a giant bowl in the middle of the prairie!
"We spent the greater part of a day just exploring the different areas, pulling off at all of the scenic outlooks!"
It was an amazing family memory!
I can't wait to go back when my wife and oldest son can join us!
My best friend is probably the most important person in my life.
I wasn't really nervous about introducing them because many of our friends say we're like two peas in a pod.
I knew he would adore her as much as I do.
"They laughed and joked a lot, and we had a very good time."
I think the best part of the night was after dinner.
"She has a little dog named Bailey, and he doesn't really like new people."
He probably enjoyed meeting Bailey more than he did my friend!
It was the perfect end to a perfect night!
I can see the three of us having a very close friendship together!
"I'd known my best friend since we were pre teens, and this was the first time they had met."
It went really well!
"I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up."
I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent up anxiety about it finally happening.
"The food was great, but the company was better."
It was nice to catch up with old friends.
"Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much."
"It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well."
I'm looking forward to spending more time with the two of them in the future.
"We had been dating for 7 months at the time, but had known each other for nearly a year."
This particular friend is probably my closest female friend.
"We share a lot about our love lives, even though we don't see each other super often."
She knows that I'd been really happy in my relationship and was eager to meet him.
I was a little nervous at first.
"I wasn't worried that she wouldn't approve or anything, but it's always a little bit of an unsure situation introducing people you're dating to old friends."
"Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully."
"Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog."
"My boyfriend made fast friends, and it was really sweet seeing him interact with her dog."
"Overall, we had a wonderful time, and I'm sure that my significant other made a good lasting impression on a very important friend of mine."
"We live in the same state, but hours away from each other so we don't get to see each other as often as we'd like."
"Life just gets in the way sometimes, especially as an adult."
He's also very big on craft beer so it seemed like a great plan.
The atmosphere was great.
I was surprised how crowded the place was.
"After that, we went to another brewery not too far from there."
Everytime we get together laughs are guaranteed.
By this point we were very hungry.
Overall it was a great weekend and I hope we can do it again sometime soon.
"I live in a large city, so I invited him because I thought there would be a lot of fun things to do."
"His train was a little late, but luckily it wasn't too long of a delay."
The next day was my brother's actual birthday.
We left my apartment around noon and got a quick lunch at a vegetarian restaurant.
"After that, we got on the bus to go to the planetarium."
"Overall, it was a really fun weekend and I was glad I could spend it with my brother."
We went there on his actual birthday for a couple hours and saw a cool show.
We had a great meal.
When we got back to my apartment we had his birthday dessert.
Overall it was a fun weekend.
I'm glad I got to celebrate with him.
"My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament."
I think we are more than capable of winning next year if we set our minds to it and can stay healthy!
We were all having fun and enjoying ourselves.
The player was a little taller than me so I knew I had to adjust my shot a bit.
During the shot I had to adjust my body in a weird angle in the air so that I wouldn't get my shot blocked.
Right now now I am going on about 2 months.
The pain usually hurts the most at night and keeps me up sometimes.
But the brace is pretty uncomfortable and itchy so I take a break every chance I get.
All in all right now this wasn't looking like the best idea.
But I guess that's just the process of going through recovery.
So hopefully after therapy is completed I will be better off.
I have been her friend since high school.
"Not only did we happen to attend the same church, we also share the same birth month."
We share so much in common.
Different career path and our family background made us attend different college although it was against our wish.
We had planned to attend the same college and even study the same course.
I attended the party with one of our other friends as she was someone we loved so much and very proud of.
Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance.
It was more than what I thought as she started talking about her ordeal in college and how she scaled through.
"She started by thanking God and her parents, the school, faculty and friends."
"As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey."
It was an overwhelming and inspirational experience for me and it made me realize who I am and what I am made of.
"We had gone to different colleges and different graduate programs so we rarely saw each other in person, maybe once or twice a year."
We were from the same hometown but neither of us had lived there for over half a decade.
The party was a pretty big deal.
"My friend is African and when they party, they really party."
I had no idea beforehand she was going to say this.
I wasn't really sure what to do in the moment.
But I did feel extremely grateful that I was important enough to her to be singled out among all the other guests.
It really reinforced the bond we've had for over ten years.
"I hope that ten years from now, we will still support and uplift each other like this."
It was an interesting reminder of how I didn't like one of those girls.
I didn't realize how fancy or big the party was going to be.
"Clearly, it was a really big deal."
"As the night progressed, we ate and danced and talked."
I was really happy I could be there for my friend.
"This included my friend's father, a Cameroonian uncle/preacher, and my friend herself."
"During her speech, she highlighted her relative's recent accomplishments including getting into pharmacy school and their own graduations."
I thought it was going to be family only but then I heard my name.
I'm sure the moment got caught by the videographer.
I was very happy to hear that my friend would include me in her special moment.
It was a nice reminder of how much our friendship has meant over the years.
It seemed like a normal day.
"In fact, it pretty much was the most normal of a day that it could had been."
"She seemed an ordinary older woman, no different than an average elderly person."
It wasn't actually my mom (obviously) but she looked similar enough where I had to go talk to her.
I told her that I thought she might be related to me.
"I told her my own name, my mother's name, and even some extended family's names."
But she said that she had never heard of any of them.
I will never forget the day that I met that woman.
She was walking home and was trying to figure out a way to carry all of her bags.
I live across the street from the grocery store so I told myself i should offer some assistance to her.
I approached her and offered my help.
I told her i would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things.
She lived nearby as well.
So i did exactly that.
We had a good time together.
I learned that she lived alone the home so grocery shopping or shopping of any kind is a challenge.
I think it's important to help others when we are able and i was able to help her.
I wanted to help her.
She's a lovely woman and now we are friends.
She knows she can count on me to help if she needs it.
I have helped her plant flowers and other items.
She was walking home and was trying to figure out a way to carry all of her bags.
She lived nearby as well.
I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you.
I felt good about helping her.
I think it's important to help others when we are able and i was able to help her.
I wanted to help her.
She knows she can count on me to help if she needs it.

"When thinking of booking travel, three words come to mind: convenience, relaxation & luxury."
When booking with JSG each of these elements has always been met & often exceeded.
"From the onset of booking our honeymoon, JSG was prompt to provide hotel recommendations that were matched with our desires for our trip to Greece."
It was incredible to walk in our room & feel so special.
The JSG team treats each of their clients exceptionally & personably.
All details are thought of from the inception of the booking process & throughout the stay.
I would highly recommend putting your trust in the JSG team to plan your next vacation!
We both look at each other and smile.
Off we go to Las Vegas Nevada.
We had too much fun to head home so quickly.
"All in all, I do not recommend going to Vegas on a whim."
In my situation it was well worth it.
It was his boss.
"We were only going to spend two days there, though I wished it could have been longer."
We placed our bags down and went off to the strip to go explore.
We just went back to the room and decided to go to sleep.
When we woke up I had remembered I left some extra money in the bags.
It was only twenty dollars but it was enough for some good breakfast.
We thought all hope was gone when we put that money in that we were expecting to lose.
We were very exited and went to cash it in.
I didn't want that so I tried my best to pass it.
It was an extremely stressful time.
"I wasn't afforded much time to prepare for the test, not even a day."
I was worried that I wasn't going to make it on time to the test.
I managed to make it there.
There was no study book or no specific time set aside for me.
"Anyways, I had to do this course in work flow and a lot of was very technical."
I was getting frustrated.
I can get nationally certified if Id like but I am firmly established with my new company.
That took a couple days.
Eventually with the pressure on I came in for a saturday to just finish this once and for all.
I thought I would be there for 2 hours.
I can just relax.
It is a great feeling.
In the end I would say it was worth it.
"I was nervous for sure, but it sounded like the chance of a lifetime."
I needed to break from reality badly.
I had been working 7 days a week for months and felt like my brain was about to explode.
My mind totally cleared and for the first time in forever I really felt at peace.
The scenery in Alaska is amazing.
It is hard to explain.
"It is so plain and vacant, but is is beautiful."
"It looks untouched, like no one has been around to destroy it like the rest of the world."
They are bigger than a car.
It was a warm winter day in the interior of Alaska with the sun shining brighter than  it has in months.
The trail was extremely fast considering the sun was melting the hard packed snow and freezing it over night.
We took off on our normal training run and the dogs were extremely focused.
We ran without a break until we got to the river and i could tell the dogs were getting tired.
"I watched in amazement as i always did when i saw moose, now was my chance to be quiet and watch because they hadn't seen me yet."
Lynx are extremely rare to see in the wild and i was excited.
"I couldn't believe that the dogs had not made a sound at this point, but they typically didn't during a needed rest."
I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.
I have never seen anything so great and beautiful from nature and probably never will.
I am very thankful for this day in Alaska as a dog musher.
My training runs with the dogs were between 5-10 miles because that’s what I typically took the guests on.
The sun was so bright the snow was a perfect texture for the dogs to get some speed.
I sat very calm and still so the dogs didn’t get alarmed.
Lynx are a pretty rare sight as they are very sneaky.
We continued the rest of the trail fast with a smile.
She sent out an invitation via email.
It said to meet at the Korean BBQ place in town at 8pm.
I am so glad I did!
The food was amazing.
They cook it on the table right in front of you.
The sauces were the best part.
There was a red bean sauce that I fell in love with.
They had real vanilla bean ice cream and some amazing cakes.
If it wasn't so expensive I would probably eat there every night.
Amy had a great time.
My other friend James said he was going home to watch Zootopia.
He asked if I wanted to join him.
It was pretty late but I have known James for a long time so I trusted him to keep me safe late at night.
It was a great night.
Dear Diary.
They ended up buying makeup for the birthday girl and a card and we were on our way.
I already had bought a gift from Amazon so I did not buy anything at Target.
We were one of the first people to get to the restaurant so we got to pick which table we wanted to sit at and thankfully we all got to sit together.
"It was interesting because my friend had invited 25 people, so many people who were invited I did not even talk to."
"I ended up sitting with people that I knew, so it was as if I just went to go out to eat with these people for no occasion."
"Nevertheless, the restaurant was so good and I had good conversation."
"The food was expensive and so was the commute (1 hour), but I still think it was worth it."
I got my friend a pusheen plushy and she seemed to really like the gift.
I was also surprised by how many people showed up.
I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while.
"It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too."
I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting.
Afterwards I met up wit my other friend to watch a movie.
I had a really good experience writing this because it made me feel all these happy feelings I felt when I was going to the party and to my friend's house.
It's pretty funny too how I forgot I even did this task and I could not remember what I had even written about.
Today was no exception.
I knew everyone was getting their projects reviewed.
The best one would be selected to be implemented by the boss.
That meant that the winner would be in charge of a team leading the project.
I wanted this very badly.
I have been working  here for 6 months and wanted a chance to show my leadership ability as well as my creativity.
There were many amazing project ideas.
It was very rewarding after all the hard work that I put into it.
I am happy to be able to be noticed for my hard work.
"Hopefully, this will only propel me forward at work."
I can't wait to share the news with my family!
i has been worked six months for the project.
i were in an deadline to submit my project.
its design chart when the day.
i were submitting my project the approval team.
were analysis my project and shown the result as accept are reject my project were select which the design.
i am little nervous when submitting my project to the organization team.
"but i feel lot of confident,after the selection of my project."
the promotion were general designer.
that was my dream position.
i worked hardly to gain the position.
that were the reason also about my self confidence.
"Today I am terrified of public speaking, even the thought of it made me tried."
"My problem was I had social anxiety so over course of 1 o 2 years I am gradually overcame my problem, without the help of any therapist."
I believed in myself.
I don't need anyone else's acceptance of me need to accept.
I m mostly  don't care about what other people think.
"hen you start and finish my presentation in a breeze,I am imagine myself being the most confident speaker during your presentations and meetings."
"this is where the core of my problem lies, A fear of public speaking is often  related with social anxiety and being afraid what others think, dislike being the center of attention being judged etc."
the way I can beat this is firstly by believing .then reassure myself because i am going to be completely else or to present their own representations.
I used to be petrified of speaking in public.
once i improved I used to be petrified speaking in public.
which I use o train people on how to become more comfortable mastering the skill of communicating effectively.
The quick tip for today is all about structure.
A lack of structure often causes a speaker to get  nervous and perform poorly.
Having a clear structure accomplishes two things.
you hardly ever forget what you want to say and You give he audience a great way to stay engaged the entire time.
I also know exactly where i am in the presentation and never have to worry about losing my train and thought.
This has been a rollercoaster of a year.
"Well, I know that anything could happen but at least it's not that!"
I am so glad that I went for that exam last spring.
I can't imagine how this would have gone had the cancer not been found when it was.
I feel like I had been taking so many things for granted.
It's amazing how a scare like this can change your perspective.
I have two young children and a wonderful life.
Sometimes I get really upset thinking what would have happened if my PSA results had not been good.
I'm also grateful that I have such great health insurance.
It is such a privilege that this scare didn't also bankrupt us.
I am relieved that my treatment didn't put us in debt.
The doctor also did was blood work.
It was 12.
391 and for a man my age it should have been less than 4.
"I have a return appointment on October 8, 2019 to check my PSA levels."
Hopefully everything will fine.
If all is good I will have my PSA levels checked every 3 months for the first year.
Then every 6 months for a couple years.
If all is good then the doctor will check my PSA levels once a year there after.
This was an unexpected life event for me!
Everything went well during the surgery.
After surgery the Doctor said everything looks good.
The doctor said he wants me to get out of bed and walk around as soon as possible.
The next morning the doctor came in the room and asked how i was feeling?
I said i was feeling good.
I was feeling pretty good.
However all and all feeling pretty good.
After a leak test not sure what that is called.
Doctor said everything is looking good.
I took the PSA test and had a return appointment the next week.
"That would have been on October 8, 2019."
Had the test done.
If all is good the doctor said we will check my PSA every 3 months for the first year.
The weather was perfect with a slight breeze.
Most of the family that attended brought side dishes.
One said Happy Father's Day and the other was Happy Birthday.
We blew the candles out on each together and laughed.
It never fails to amaze me the delight in a young child's eyes.
"When evening hit, I knew it was time for me to get home before it got too dark out."
I hugged everyone.
"When I said goodbye to my grandson, I thanked him for sharing his special day with me."
I wouldn't change this day for the world.
We had other people over as well.
they were real bugs encased in acrylic.
He really loved them and could not stop playing with them as well as his little brother.
And we all had fun.
A great light outdoor shirt.
it was so fun having everone over and it was a big success.
I look forward to the next event we have.
The kids and grandkids grow up so fast.
And look forward to doing it again next year.
We had so much fun with the kids and having everyone over also.
We all wathed the balloon for a long time and got it on video.
He watched it after about 10 minutes it disappeared.
We always have good weather in June for the occasion.
Hope to have a great one again this year.
