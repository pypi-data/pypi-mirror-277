And we all know bisexuals are just on the road to being gay.
But you can't be a lesbian! What will I tell my friends?!
"Does Bin Laden, due to the way he died, look more feminine to his followers and, thus, more ridiculous?"
"He seems so gay: he's quiet, he likes poetry and he has a lisp. But you can never tell him I said this, because I don't want to make him feel like there's something wrong with him."
"I can't work out how to do that, that's not how girl brains work."
I don't think Velma Kelly can be played by a black girl. It just wouldn't seem right.
I don't understand bisexuals. Why can't they just pick a side?
"I hate an Indian giver, don't you? It's a gift ... keep your gift."
"I hate when parents give their kids ghetto names. Shaniqua, Laquisha... how could you do that to your kid?"
"I love Broadway Musicals, Lady Gaga, and Karen Walker. I'm a gay man trapped in a woman's body. Happy National Coming Out Day."
"I love gay guys, they're so much fun! I would love to have a gay guy best friend, but lesbians are just annoying."
"I mean, I'm all for feminism... but I just worry that if women all join the workforce, birth rates will plummet and the human race will go extinct."
I want to steal a black baby.  Black babies are just so much cuter than white babies!
"I'm fine with gays, and I'm fine with lesbians, but it's the people who can't decide that bother me. Like, the ones who can't decide which ones they like more, or what gender they are. You have to pick a side people!"
"I'm probably such a racist, but a black man dressed as Santa is just wrong."
"If she wears those shorts out there, it's her own fault if she get's into 'trouble.'"
"It was really horrible. There were, like, five Indians, and they all sat around talking about, like, brown shit, and it was the most shitty thing ever. I was hoping that there would be someone I could talk to, but they were all Indian. I mean the tooly kind of shitty Indian, not like you. You're okay."
It's definitely not just a label. WHETHER YOU'RE A BOY OR A GIRL DEFINES EVERYTHING YOU ARE.
It's not fair that my son has to compete with illegal immigrants for college admissions.
"It's terrible!  And it's not like she was doing something wrong, like walking around late at night."
Look at the color of your skin! You should know Spanish!
"Maybe if your skin cleared up a little and you lost weight, you wouldn't be so depressed."
Oh wait you're Black; they practically guarantees you'd get into that college.
"Oh, I would never date a bisexual. I'd always worry they would cheat on me with a guy. Plus, they aren't seriously gay, they are just pretending to be because it's 'hip.'"
"Stop trying to say you're some kind of minority just because you're mixed. You look white, okay?!"
"That haircut is usually cute on punk and goth girls, but you should have kept the bangs in the front. It's more feminine."
"There are black magazines, black award shows, black college scholarships and black television channels. Since all of these things would be unacceptable for whites, it seems that the more privileged race is black."
"There are some funny women, but even on the stand-up circuit, where there's no one casting anything, women are not proportionally as funny [as men]."
"There's hot girls all around, but he wants a committed relationship. Who wants a committed relationship? What are you, fucking gay?"
"There's nothing wrong with a woman having a picture of her girlfriend at your desk. I mean, everyone likes to have pictures of their loved ones at their workplace. Unless, *giggles* she's butch! Hahaha!"
"They (Native people) need to stop being so difficult and complaining! They already get so much from our tax money, what more do they want?"
Those women in the Middle East are so oppressed.  The saddest part is they are not educated enough to know anything else. They don't know any better.
"Well, I wanted to go to Columbia, but of course I didn't get in because I'm a middle-class white guy."
Whenever black people come to the beach I start saying 'It got so dark over here' and they never know what I'm talking about because they're dumb.
Wow you look so Mexican in this picture! You look so much better now!
"You can major in two things. They don't necessarily have to be related. For example, I majored in Chemistry and African Studies and they don't really have anything to do with each other except for AIDS."
"You could pass for Dominican; some of them are really dark and have bad hair like you. Luckily, I got the GOOD hair""."""
"You see, that's the difference between you and me. I have good hair, and you have nigger hair."
"You should apply for the assistant manager job. You're the most knowledgeable here, and besides, for a female you've got a backbone."
You should enter a few more tournaments.  A pretty girl like you will do well with the male judges.
"You're a woman, you can't carry that. Get your brother to do the men's work."
"You're so white... you're so not a black girl. I don't understand why you get upset when I say this... You don't act black."""""
