I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK.

user: It would be even funnier if you did attend the rally but weren't the giant tea bag guy I added to your user page. Did you?
user: I note the copyvio tag you placed on <url>. How do readers compare the content at the source you specified with the content of the article text you removed?
"user: Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don't think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable. My question is more a procedural one: if an RfC doesn't generate consensus, and an edit war continues, what's the next step?"
user: I tried <url> and it worked for me. What articles did you try using it on?
user: There have been no comments for over two weeks at <url>.  Do you think it might be time to make one more post on the math and physics talk pages and then edit the header to say consensus has been reached?

user: Rxe9nyi leaves out the other gruesome details and adds the context of the fortress.  Do you know which details are in the most widespread and/or original version of this tale?

"user: Thanks, but I am now having trouble finding it. Any suggestions?"
"user: Would you be willing to do another pre-FAC review of a different article for me?  Specifically, the ""John J. Tigert"" article?"

Would you mind if I changed to something more representative of the practice, like a symposium image?"
user: Nice.  What SVG editor did you use?
user: I'm working on improving the references on Kulwicki's article to get more reliable ones. I've also worked on improving <url>'s article toward GA. Do you know much about drag racing?

"user: Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month: I've noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old, long-deleted monthly categories in the <person> queue, because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again. I'm just putting this forward as an idea for discussion, and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone, I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and/or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category, it would retag the article to the ''current'' month instead of recreating the old one?"
"user: I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article?"
"user: Thank you for the links and the explanation. I'd like to help with the project, what did you have in mind?"
"user: Hi, <url> moved <url> to <url>, and then a bot came in to correct a double redirect so that the page can't simply be moved back again. Can you use your administrative powers to make it so?"
"user: Sorry for the late reply, but I usually check new additions from the bottom of the page, not the top. What is your disappointment regarding?"
"user: I want to send you a private message, but you don't have an e-mail address registered with your Wikipedia account. How could I contact you?"
user: Hi. Is there any chance of getting <url> unblocked from making edits on Wikipedia?
"user: OK, I've started the deletion debate at <url>. As a major contributor, would you mind indicating there that you agree with deleting the page?"
user: Another admin has already deleted the article. Do you need me to restore it for you?
user: We are working on adding some information regarding the significance of the podcast. Do you have any additional tips on improving out article's quality?
user: I've started an article called <url>. Would you be able to do a good intro paragraph?
"user: Slightly more seriously, there's a discussion over at <url> about the lack of non-European info regards torture.  Any chance that in your manifold research on all things psychohistorical you've found something that could be used to expand the section?"
"user: Katy, good buddy.  Is <url> your lost article?"
user: Thanks for adding that ref to <url>. I don't suppose your copy of Conway's says anything about the roles and fates of ''Schleswig-Holstein'' or ''Schleisen''?
user: Hello. I was wondering if any of the books you have can shed much more light on <url>?
user: I have made a Ukrainian version. Were would you like me to email it to?
user: You're welcome. Do you have an opinion as to whether they would be worth adding to <url>?
user: Sounds like a great idea. Do you want to propose it at the project talk page?
user: Anytime. How do you like this closer crop?
"user: |} Thanks! Did you know its one week to Halloween, will you be there?"
"user: Thanks for blocking this user -- he promptly erased the warnings on his talk page (I put them back).  I guess a block doesn't automatically block the talk page, huh?"
"user: Hi, I see you were involved in creating the ship infobox. Would you be interested in creating an infobox for windmills so that I could use it on individual windmill articles?"
"user: Thanks; what should I do next time to make it easier, quicker?  Just let you know?"
"user: I think the article needs work. For example, I think ""U.S. late 1980s - 1990s"" should after ""Detroit sound."" ""UK 1990s"" should after ""U.S. late 1980s - 1990s."" What do you think?"
"user: When I wrote <url> I was not quite sure if it was a synonym of <url>, and hence did not perform a merge. Could you clarify if they are indeed the same, and if so whether we should merge the articles?"
user: I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory?
"user: My graphics editing skills aren't up to the creation of a map such as this from scratch, but I could probably do an adequate job of removing the red and orange lines and the related entries in the map legend. Would it be useful for me to take a whack at that?"
"user: Hi, thanks for letting me know about my signature not being linked. I tried to save the settings in preferences - did it work?"
"user: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?"
user: Yes please! Buffing up ''<url>'' to at least reflect a bit better on current state-of-play-taxonomically would be good :) Any Reliable Sources call it a <url> ?
"user: Hi, I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT. However, I was just wondering if, when you add to Schools, whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section, please?"
user: I wish I could find a better one but I don't think I know where one is I think the composition needs more information. Can you do that?
"user: Hey Alex... I just emailed a United Kingdom professor, intending to email a University of Kentucky professor. If he expresses interest, are you the person he should talk to?"
user: Wonderful! :) Do you particularly like to work on comics creators' articles?
"user: Up to you - I see myself picking off one or two every now and then but nowhere near the level of work NortyNort is doing now. By the way, I have an open CCI request that I want a second opinion on - could you please help?"
user: Would you mind doing the same for <url>?
"user: Just one more thing: The <url>' logo was re-made as a vector image a little while ago, but the colors (especially the skin), really seem to be off. Can you fix it?"
"user: I think I updated the pharmacology project banner to put C-class articles into the appropriate category (previously, it was putting them into the unassessed class. If you want to double-check, that would be great; I think it may take a little while for it to update the articles?"
"user: Hi Royalbroil, I can't seem to find a hook I entered in DYK Feb 24, it's about the novel <url>, along with suggestions from other eds. Can you find what happened to it, please?"
user: Out of curiosity what are you testing? How are things going?
user: thanks for the welcome! I have a question... how come you can't edit the article about Whales?

"user: Hello Alex! Since you are experienced in ''botovodstvo'', could you help us with the issue <url>?"
user: I really like the template you used at <url> but it dosen't seem to exist on the  WP:Vandalism page. Where can I grab it?
"user: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?"
user: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?
"user: On a related note, I went through your recent article-work, and saw nothing wrong with your contributions. I was wondering, would you like me to grant your account <url> to make it easier to revert vandalism when you come across it?"
"user: Alternatively, maybe the second column could be '''Country of origin''' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA/Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA/USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts?"
"user: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used ""on"".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?"
"user: Yes, it is a matter of civility.  Do you think a year would be better?"
"user: Hi, I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this.  Could you see my comments on <url>?"
"user: Unfortunately, I have no clue what you mean.  Can you point me to a page that has such a feature?"
"user: I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I'm not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments. If he keeps messaging, would it be ok if I got back in touch with you and you had a word with him?"
"user: Hi, Google found your start at a Bayt Nuba article.  Do you want help?"
"user: Hi, I'd like to help you with the image you just uploaded to the <url> article.  Can you tell me where you found it?"
user: Thanks for that - very nicely commented code (rare to see)! It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy?
user: I look forward to your genre plan. What do you have in mind?
"user: Presumably the CfD will be inconclusive. Given the technical issues, perhaps an RfC might be more helpful?"
user: David Sprenkle was at the University of Illinois in 1982 (at least part of it) while I was there.  Were you there too?
user: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?
"user: I am not familiar with the credit card / porn star identity incident you mentioned in AnonEMouse's RFA, but I would like to take a closer look at it.  Could you provide some more direct diffs related to Mouse's involvment?"
"user: It seems you have been investigating this administrator and have brought up several incidents in your evidence based on that. If possible, could you please link to the feedback that Dreadstar has received as an administrator during/after each of those incidents (and if there was no feedback to any of those incidents, could you please let me know in reply to this)?"
"user: I see you ended the AfD on <url> and removed the tag.  Will you remove it on the other two articles that were proposed along with it, <url> and <url>?"

"user: Hey, I'm inquiring about my <url> a few months ago for photos from the Flames-Rangers game that took place last week. I've gotten a few of these since then, but just wondering if you remembered and got any shots that would be worth using on here?"
user: Perhaps you can help me. How do I view the status of a vandalism report I've made?
"user: I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?"
"user: Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?"
"user: It was nominated for speedy deletion because he wasn't notable. However, if I undelete the page, will you improve the article and be able to provide decent sources to help his notability?"
user: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?
"user: I was doing some minor editing on this, and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don't match. Could you take a look at this and see which is correct?"
user: Yes I am planning to. Is that good?
user: I went to <url> and couldn't find it. Can you provide a link?
"user: I'm sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn. Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee?"
"user: I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again.  Are you still interested in such a thing?"
"user: Thanks for the help on the sides of leather question.  I'm interested in citing the dictionary in the article as a reference for the meaning of ""sides"", but I'd like to have a little more data first u2014 what year's edition of the OED did you cite?"

"user: The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover  - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992).  Are those his scholarly works?"
"user: <url> is at it again, adding in the ""in the Premiership"" content you & I successfully merged several weeks ago. Could you perhaps also drop a note on his talk page asking him to stop?"
user: Thanks!  What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature?
"user: On another note, I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct? If so, could you kindly point me towards your source?"
"user: Do you still take photos in Jefferson Parish? If so, would it be alright if I posted some photo requests of some parish high schools?"
user: I have just put the article to peer review. Would you care to take a look?
"user: Thanks for the response.  May I ask, are you a video gamer?"
user: Noticed you've been holding the fort alone... again :) Thought I'd drop by and say hello. Surely your sanity has reached its limits by now?

user: Hi Fropuff. How do you convert your commutative diagrams from LaTeX to PNG?

user: Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I'm only asking directly  because the vandalism is continuing and I'm close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP's vandalism back to my last revision?
user: Thanks for protecting this. Perhaps no longer needed?
"user: Ha, you're too kind to me, my old friend. MK one day, promise?"
user: It appears that you deleted my comments and vote on <url>. May I ask why?
user: That's a good idea. What about army and corps HQs though?
user: What are you having a problem with? Are you having trouble with the ssh authentication?
user: Okay thanks. Any easy way to determine this?
user: Thank you. So what did I do to earn the tea?
"user: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?"
"user: One more thing if you want, let's talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let's talk there instead, ok?"
user: Thanks for your input. Would you mind voicing your opinion in the GMC's talk page?
user: This is great so far! What do you feel you need help with?
"user: Thanks for the redirect help!  Is that something I can do myself in the future, or is that an admin thing?"
user: Interesting illustration on the PrIze law page of a Zeppelin taking a Norwegian vessel as a prize in 1917.  I wonder whether you could point me to a source for more information on this incident?
"user: Thanks for adding the WSL windmill picture. I see you are in Belgium, any chance of adding more pictures to the various lists?"
user: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?
"user: And after seeing this talk page, I'll also note that there is no difference between scalars in math, physics and computing, those articles should all be merged together. :-/ Maybe you'd be interested in doing such a merge?"
user: Interrobang has asked me if I would also help mentor you when he is not around. I said that I would gladly help out if it was ok with you?
"user: I'm on it. Instead, could I persuade you to offer comments on the FAC page of <url>?"
"user: Arguably, listing the former constructors and even the template itself is not necessary. Could we please try reinstating the previous version and see if and how many other folk don't find the decade information useful/intriguing?"
"user: Since working on the article you wrote, I have become fascinated with this band.  Is any of their music availabe online?"
"user: Don't worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you're still not convinced you should get an account?"
user: Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account?
"user: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of ""notability"" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of ""notability"" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?"
"user: Hi I noticed that you changed the category at <url> from ""People from Alabama"" to ""People from Elmore County, Alabama"". Is this appropriate, as Opothleyahola was dead for three years before Elmore county had been organized and had been forcibly removed from the area more than thirty years before?"
"user: Regarding your time setting, I'm a little unsure what you want to do - there are only two things you can change - the timezone offset from GMT, which you set at the bottom of the screen by selecting the correct offset for your location from the list - I'm guessing Asia/Calcutta would be about right, and the way the date/time is displayed, which you choose from the list of five options at the top of the screen. What problems are you having ?"
"user: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?"
user: Hi again! Have you had a chance to get it lately?
user: I restored the lead picture series I like. What do you think?

user: Okay thanks I'll try it! DId you choose the pictures yourself?
user: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?
