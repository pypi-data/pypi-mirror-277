# Fictometer

## Description

Fictometer is an algorithm for analysing whether the given text is ```Fiction``` or ```Non-Fiction```.
It first calculates the number of ```adverbs```, ```adjectives``` and ```pronouns``` in the text.
It then calculates Ratio of Adjective to Pronoun ```RADJPRON``` and Ratio of Adverb to Adjective ```RADVADJ```, 
from which it predicts whether text is ```Fiction``` or ```Non-Fiction```.
