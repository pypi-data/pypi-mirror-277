## Geni

[![ci](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/geni/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-python3/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Geni helps you generate large-scale datasets.

```python
import geni
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

# Create a generator
def generator() -> dict:
    return {
        "name": fake.name(),
        "age": fake.random_int(18, 99),
        "city": fake.city()
    }

geni.generate_file(generator, row=1000, output="data.csv")
```

## The latest version

You can find the latest version to ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/geni.git
```

## Usage

## Developper guideline

### Add a dependency

``bash
poetry add requests
``
### Install development environment

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and install the
python dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

### Update release dependencies

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and freeze
dependencies version

```bash
poetry update update
```

### Activate the python environment

When you setup the requirements, a `venv` directory on python 3 is created.
To activate the venv, you have to execute :

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Run the continuous integration process

Before commit or send a pull request, you have to execute `pylint` to check the syntax
of your code and run the unit tests to validate the behavior.

```bash
$ poetry run alfred ci
```
