Example Use
------------
This example is intended to be used with the [Micro OLED Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14532) board. (See the <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_OLED_Base_Py/tree/main/examples">examples directory</a> for more detailed use cases.)

```python
import qwiic_oled_base
import sys


def runExample():

    #  These lines of code are all you need to initialize the OLED display and print text on the screen.

    print("\nSparkFun Micro OLED Hello Example\n")
    myOLED = qwiic_oled_base.QwiicOledBase()

    if myOLED.is_connected() == False:
        print("The Qwiic Micro OLED device isn't connected to the system. Please check your connection", \
            file=sys.stderr)
        return

    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init all of the pins and configure the OLED.
    myOLED.begin()

    myOLED.clear(myOLED.PAGE)  #  Clear the display's buffer

    myOLED.print("Hello World")  #  Add "Hello World" to buffer

    #  To actually draw anything on the display, you must call the display() function. 
    myOLED.display()

runExample()
```
