### Modified

- Support for parallel computing with dask was extended at `xcompact3d_toolbox.genepsi.gene_epsi_3D`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 2021-10-07

- Add tutorial *Reading and writing files*, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Modified

- Automatically obtain `io.Dataset.data_path` from `parameters.Parameter.filename` during initialization (e.g., if `filename = "./example/input.i3d"` then `data_path = "./example/data/"`). Of course, `data_path` can be changed to any value after that. By [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- `io.Dataset.load_wind_turbine_data` now have a default location for `file_pattern`. Attributes were included for the coordinate time. By [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- `io.Dataset.set` now accepts keyword arguments to send to `io.FilenameProperties.set`, for a more concise syntax. By [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Added

- Add `load_wind_turbine_data` that reads the files from the disc and wraps the data into a `xarray.Dataset`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Fixed

- `Black` version was not working properly at `setup.py`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/releases/tag/v1.0.0) - 2021-09-14

Xcompact3d-toolbox has evolved considerably in the last year.
The pre-release version has been employed in CFD research projects, and the feedback from the users helped to improve its interfaces and functionalities.
The integration between this Python package and the numerical solver [XCompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d) were experimental, and many of the functionalities were only available in a forked repository for a test of concept ([fschuch/Xcompact3d](https://github.com/fschuch/Xcompact3d)). These features are now part of the main repository [XCompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d) (see [PR #51](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d/pull/51)).
With this, Xcompact3d-toolbox is ready for its first stable release.

### Added

- Support for stretched mesh at the xdmf writer and automated tests for it, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- A class to handle the binary filenames and its tests. Now all methods support different filenames, like the classic `ux000`, or the new `ux-0000.bin`, besides some combinations between them. By [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Classes to handle the coordinates and their tests, so they can be moved out of the parameters class, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- New class for the 3D coordinate system, with useful methods and its testes, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Add `class Dataset` to read the binary files from XCompact3d on-demand, it is possible to loop through the snapshots, select any of them or read the entire time-series for a given variable. It returns them in a proper `xarray.Dataset`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Sets of dependencies for extra functionalities, like docs, tests and visu, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- More parameters are now covered in the Parameters class, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Add type hints to many functions and class methods, for a better development experience using modern IDEs, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Modified

- Writing methods for the binary files were moved from the xarray accessors to the Dataset class, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- The new sandbox flow configuration is now set with `itype = 12`, following its addition the XCompact3d's main repository (see [#51](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d/pull/51)), by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- The documentation was improved, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Fixed

- Not installing all dependencies with `pip install`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Suppressed warning from `tqdm`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- The output format from `gene_epsi_3D` has changed, fixing some compatibility issues with XCompact3d as well (see [#51](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d/pull/51)), by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

## [0.1.11](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/releases/tag/v0.1.11) - 2021-02-12

### Fixed

- Fix #8, a little incompatibility problem with xcompact3d was fixed, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/fschuch/xcompact3d_toolbox/releases/tag/v0.1.10) - 2021-02-11

### Added

- Add support for the previous parameters format `.prm` (#7), by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Class `ParametersGui`, a subclass from `Parameters`, but with widgets, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Argument `loadfile` added to class `Parameters`, so it is possible to initialize and load form the disc with just one line of code `prm = x3d.Parameters(loadfile='example.i3d')`, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Changed

- Changed from method `__call__` to `__repr__` at `parameters.py` as the procedure to show the parameters on screen, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
- Functions to read binary fields where moved from `io.py` to methods at `parameters.py`, so the syntax is simplified from `x3d.read_field('filename', prm)` to just `prm.read_field('filename')`. by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Fixed

- Scale factor for Ahmed Body at sandbox, by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).

### Fixed

- First derivative was incorrect when `ncl1=1` and `ncln=2`. by [@fschuch](https://github.com/fschuch).
