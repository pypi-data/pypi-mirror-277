# A Python library/web app to simulate quantum-scale physics

Features include (but not limited to):

- create particles in a simulated environment
- create potential fields to account for external forces
- propagate particles (using the titular Schr√∂dinger's equation)
- draw and animate graphs
- ~~access boundary error, core dumped~~ totally not run out of memory
  - on the other hand, Python.

[docs](https://1p22geo.github.io/schrodinger/doc/)

Includes everything except for the user experiment engine.
All static files and tutorials included.

## Deploying it yourself

- Install python 3.10 or newer
- First install the required libraries:
  - flask
  - numpy
  - scipy
