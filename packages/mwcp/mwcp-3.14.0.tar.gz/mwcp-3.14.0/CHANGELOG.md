# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.14.0] - 2024-05-29

### Added
- Added `secret` and `key_derivation` fields to `EncryptionKey` metadata for storing KDF information.
- `construct` utility:
  - Added `RegexSearch` and `RegexMatch` helpers.
  - Added ability to embed constructs using `*` unpacking.

### Changed
- All pefileutils functions that are meant to return lists now return empty lists when empty instead of `None`.
- The temporary directory created by `FileObject.temp_path()` will not be deleted if `keep` is set to True 
  or the `--keep-tmp` command line flag is used. The last directory created will be symbolically
  linked to `mwcp_current`.
- Relaxed `construct` version requirement to support 2.9 or 2.10

### Removed
- Dropped support for Python 3.8


## [3.13.1] - 2023-11-29

### Changed
- Catch OSError from DateTime related constructs and raise as ConstructError
- `FileObject` objects now also accept bytearrays for the `file_data` field.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug causing files to be unprocessed when using yara recursion with a dispatched file with a modified parent. (#40)


## [3.13.0] - 2023-07-17

### Added
- Added `cwd` to `Command` metadata object.
- Added `ScheduledTask` metadata object. (#38)
- Added `--cov` flag to `mwcp test` command for enabling code coverage for parsers. (see [documentation](docs/ParserTesting.md#code-coverage))

### Changed
- Improved handling of STIX results for `Network` objects.
- The `dc3:ISO` parser has been updated to handle ISO 9660 `UDF`, `Joliet`, and `Rock Ridge` extensions.
  - Consequently, the `isoparser` dependency has been replaced with `pycdlib`.


## [3.12.0] - 2023-04-20

### Changed
- Updated schema:
  - `URL2` and `Socket2` objects replace `URL` and `Socket` objects.
  - New `Network` object contains `URL2`, `Socket2` and `Credential`.
  - `URL2` objects no longer contain `socket` or `credential` fields. This behavior is deprecated and is meant for the `Network` object.
  - `Socket2` objects no longer contain a `c2` field. Instead, `c2` must be added as a tag to the `Socket2` or `URL2`. `C2SocketAddress`, `C2Address`, and `C2URL` automatically add the `c2` tag to the relevant `Socket2` or `URL2`.
- Improved STIX output for modified objects.

#### Fixed
- Fixed issue with web server not providing a proper json response when STIX output is enabled.
- Fixed report display when a nested element contains a tag.


## [3.11.0] - 2023-02-21

### Added
- Added ability to provide external knowledge_base information. (see [documentation](docs/ParserComponents.md#external-knowledge))

### Changed
- Configuration will now be validated on startup.
- Added better failure message when running a recursive test case without a YARA repo setup.
- `Dispatcher.knowledge_base` has been moved to `Report.knowledge_base`. The original location is deprecated and will eventually be removed.
- `Report.as_stix()` no longer requires a writer and will now return serialized JSON results. 
  - Please use `Report.write_stix()` for original functionality.

### Fixed
- `mwcp config` CLI command will now still work even if the config file is invalid.
- `--yara-repo` flag will now properly be read when running a test.
- Fixed memory leak issues due to lingering report references.


## [3.10.1] - 2023-02-03

### Added
- [packaging](https://pypi.org/project/packaging/) dependency

### Fixed
- Use `packaging.version` for version comparison with test results


## [3.10.0] - 2023-01-25

### Added
- Added `.with_encoding()` function on `EncryptionKey` metadata elements for telling MWCP how to display encryption keys in the text report.

### Changed
- Improved handling of displaying decodable encryption keys.
- YaraRunner will now skip compiling rule files without 'mwcp' meta defined.
- Parser test cases can now be added or updated with recursive YARA matching by adding the `--recursive` flag to the `mwcp test` command.

### Fixed
- Fixed IDA project file not being output for 64-bit samples.
- Fixed issue with duplicate residual files when using recursive YARA matching.
- Fixed memory leak that occurs when processing multiple runs subsequently in the same process.


## [3.9.0] - 2022-11-22
### Added
- Added `FileObject.ext` property for getting and setting the file's extension.
- Added builtin parsers.
- Added YARA matching capability to automatically determine which parser(s) to run. (see [documentation](README.md#yara-matching)) 

### Changed
- Improved aliasing in parser configuration file.
  - Aliases can now be used for pointing to individual parser components. (e.g. `PDF: .Document`) This helps to avoid the need to create parser groups just for pointing to a single parser component.
  - External pointers are no longer limited to just inside parser groups. Aliases can now also point to external parsers (e.g. `DecoyDOC: dc3:Decoy.DOC`) 

### Removed
- Removed legacy `mwcp.Reporter` object.  
- Removed `cleanup_temp_files` option from `mwcp.Runner` object.
- Removed `temp_directory` option from `mwcp.Runner` object.
- Removed deprecated components from `mwcp.Runner` (these components should be pulled from the generated Report object instead):
  - `.managed_tempdir`
  - `.add_metadata()`
  - `.input_file`
  - `.metadata`
  - `.output_file()`
  - `.errors`
  - `.run_parser()`
  - `.print_report()`
  - `.print_report()`
  - `.get_output_text()`
  - `.fields`
- Removed deprecated `.managed_tempdir` from `mwcp.Report` object.

## [3.8.0] - 2022-09-14

### Added
- Added `Report.strings()` convenience function for obtaining reported decoded strings.
- Added option to produce external string reports for decoded strings instead of being included in the main report.
  -  Reports will be added as supplemental files with original name suffixed with `_strings.json` and `_strings.txt`.
  - Use the `--string-report` flag to enable this in the CLI tool.
  - Use the `external_strings` field to enable this in the server.

### Changed
- `DecodedString` metadata is now included in legacy report output.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `Path2.from_segments()` ignoring previous segments when another segment starts with a slash.
- Fixed issue with throwing of `UnableToParse` sometimes causing the residual file not to be reported.
- Files for which a parser throws an `UnableToParse` and end up not getting identified by any other parsers will
  now appropriately be identified as "Unidentified file". (NOTE: This change may cause previous test cases to fail.)
- Fixed bug with `Report.get()` and `Report.iter()` returning elements that don't match requested type.
- Fixed bug in STIX output when a parser added a tag to a piece of metadata that translated to an observed-string.


## [3.7.0] - 2022-06-28

### Added
- STIX 2.1 output format that includes three SCO extensions and one property extension.  This generates a STIX package containing the results of the full analysis.
  - SCO Extensions
    - observed-string
    - crypto-currency-address
    - symmetric-encryption
  - Property Extensions
    - extension-definition--b84c95f5-d48d-4e4a-b723-7d209a02deb9 -- RSA Private key extension for x509-certificate
- Added `Path2` metadata element which simplifies fields from `Path` and better supports non-Windows paths.
  - `name` and `directory_path` are removed in favor of just having a `path` element.
  - Added `posix` field to indicated if path is Posix or Windows based.
  - Added `.from_segments()` and `.from_pathlib_path()` constructors.
- Added `derivation` field to `FileObject` object and `File` metadata element.
- Added `FileObject.disassembly()` function for obtaining Dragodis dissassembler.

### Fixed
- AttributeError that can occur during testing if a Registry without a path was reported.
- Disables skipping recursive files to avoid a breaking bug with greedy parsers.
  - This is temporary until a proper fix can be implemented.
- Fixed issue with process stalling when integer is provided in a bytes metadata field.

### Deprecated
- `Path` is deprecated in favor of `Path2`.
  - NOTE: Once deprecations are removed, `Path2` will be renamed back to `Path`.


## [3.6.2] - 2022-04-04

### Fixed
- config.load now accepts file_path as a string on pathlib.Path (@rhartig-ct)
  - In 3.6.1 config.load was updated to take pathlib.Path, but mwcp.tools.server still used string

## [3.6.1] - 2022-03-28

### Fixed
- AttributeError that can occur during testing if a Registry without a path was reported.
- Disables skipping recursive files to avoid a breaking bug with greedy parsers.
  - This is temporary until a proper fix can be implemented.


## [3.6.0] - 2022-03-23

### Added
- `Command` metadata element.
- `CryptoAddress` metadata element.
- `Report.add_tag()` which allows adding tags to the report itself.
- Added ability to include `TAGS` attribute in `Parser` classes.

- Added `.from_PEM()`, `.from_DER()`, `.from_BLOB()`, and `.from_XML()` construction methods for `RSAPublicKey` and `RSAPrivateKey` metadata elements.
- Added `Registry2` metadata element which includes the following changes from `Registry`:
  - `path` attribute has been removed.
  - `key` attribute has been renamed to `subkey` and no longer includes the root hive key.
  - `hive` attribute has been added which is casted to a `metadata.RegistryHive` enum type. `hive` will automatically be extracted if not provided but included in `subkey`.
  - `data_type` attribute has been added, which is a `metadata.RegistryDataType` enum type. `data_type` will automatically be inferred from the data type of `data` if not provided.
  - Added a `.from_path()` constructor to generate an entry from a full path.
- Added `mwcp download` CLI command to download sample files from the malware repo.
  - Includes `--last-failed` flag to download samples from previously failed tests.

### Changed

- Added detection of recursive loop parsing the same file.
  - Duplicate files will automatically be tagged with `duplicate` and not be parsed.
- If a parser dispatches the file it is currently processing, it will now be ignored.

### Deprecated
- `Dispacher.add_to_queue()` is deprecated in favor of `Dispatcher.add()`.
- `Registry` is deprecated in favor of `Registry2`. 
  - NOTE: Once deprecations are removed, `Registry2` will be renamed back to `Registry`.


## [3.5.0] - 2022-01-11

### Added
- Added `--command` flag to `mwcp test`. This flag will provide the user with a printout of the pytest 
command that would be run given the other options provided in the command line.

### Changed
- The `--no-legacy` flag is now set by default for `mwcp parse` and `mwcp test` commands. 
  - **If you still need to use legacy testing or parse results, you must now explicitly include the `--legacy` flag.**
  - *This does not affect the web service tool. For now, legacy mode is still set as default.*
- Updated the `Other` metadata element to accept string, bytes, integers, or booleans as values.
  - Also, added new field `value_format` to show the data type of the value. This helps to avoid any ambiguities in json results.
- The "Tags" column in the generated report won't be shown if there are no tags in the table.

### Fixed
- Fixed UnicodeDecodeError that can occur when printing a report with nested metadata elements. ([\#31](https://github.com/dod-cyber-crime-center/DC3-MWCP/issues/31))
- Include missing "Mode" column from EncryptionKey report tables.
- Fixed rendering for values with line breaks in the HTML report output.
- Removed obfuscated powershell examples from poshdeob causing a VT hit. ([\#32](https://github.com/dod-cyber-crime-center/DC3-MWCP/issues/32))


## [3.4.0] - 2021-10-06

### Added
- Added a formal schema for (non-legacy) JSON report output which can be found in [schema.json](/mwcp/config/schema.json)
- Added `mwcp schema` CLI command to generate the current schema.
- Added [documentation](/README.md#schema) on how to create your own custom reportable metadata element.

### Changed
- Updated server dependencies.
- The `input_file` and `residual_file` metadata types are now both referred to as `file`.
- Legacy versions of `uuid` and `interval` metadata types are now typed as `uuid_legacy` and `interval_legacy`
  respectively. This was done to ensure a proper schema can be generated.
- Updated testing utility to ensure test cases older than 3.3.3 handle changes accordingly.
- Updated the regular expression in the `URL` metadata object allowing it to succeed with optional schema
- `URL` metadata object no longer defaults the network protocol to `tcp` for embedded `socket`

### Fixed
- Fixed `EncryptionKey` report formatting to display text representation when key is printable (not just ascii).
- The `--testcase-dir` flag when running `mwcp test` in non-legacy mode will now handle any directory structure.


## [3.3.2] - 2021-07-19

### Added
- Added `mode` attribute for EncryptionKey to report on block cipher mode.
  - Updated testing utility to ensure test cases older than 3.3.2 ignore this new property.

### Changed
- Added word wrap for long fields in a generated report.
- Switched "html" report output format to be consistent with "simple" and "markdown" formats.
- Improved display formatting for EncryptionKey, RSAPrivateKey, and RSAPublicKey.

### Fixed
- Fixed test case path for `foo` parser, changed to a path which will always exist since input file is irrelevant. (@ddash-ct)
- Fixed issue with results in the new metadata style not being dedupped across file sources.
- Split report results are now correctly ordered by processing order.
- Fixed issue with running `mwcp test -u` command to update all legacy parser tests.
- Fixed bug with differently ordered tags causing test cases to fail.

### Removed
- Removed unused `split` argument in `Report` initialization.


## [3.3.1] - 2021-06-28

### Added
- Added support for providing a custom logging filter when running a parser.

### Changed

- Fixed "can't set attribute" error occurring when using web server.


## [3.3.0] - 2021-06-10

*NOTE: This release may require updating setuptools to successfully install.*

### Added
- Added `mwcp.run()` as a shortcut for running a parser and getting back its results. (See [documentation](/README.md#python-api))
- Added ability to provide a `mwcp.Parser` class directly to `mwcp.run()`.
  This is helpful for quick one-off scripting.
- Added `--split` option within the `mwcp parse` command, which changes the report to display
  metadata split by originating file instead of all being consolidating with the initial input file.
  (This option is only available when `--no-legacy` is enabled.)
- The `Report` class now includes the following output options for programmatically rendering results in different formats:
  - `.as_text()` - Renders sectioned tables of results in a simple text format (this is the default format when using the command line).
  - `.as_markdown()` - Renders sectioned tables of results in markdown.
  - `.as_html()` - Renders a flat table of results in html.
  - `.as_csv()` - Renders a flat table of results in csv.
  - `.as_dataframe()` - Produces a flat table of results in a pandas dataframe.
  - `.file_tree()` - Renders an ascii tree representing the hierarchy of residual files.
- Added ability to add tags to metadata elements. (See [documentation](/docs/ParserComponents.md#tagging))
- Added DecodedString metadata element.
- Added `.compile_time` attribute to `FileObject`.
- Added `.architecture` attribute to `FileObject`.
- Added ability to pass results from `Parser.identify()` into the `Parser.run()` function. (See [documentation](/docs/ParserDevelopment.md#passing-identify-results))


### Changed
- MWCP version can now be accessed from `mwcp.__version__`
- Updated metadata mechanism to an objected-oriented approach. (See [documentation](/docs/ParserComponents.md#report))
- `mwcp.Reporter` has been replaced with `mwcp.Runner`. (However, using `mwcp.run()` is now recommended.)
- Updated json and text report output.
  - NOTE: To keep backwards compatibility, the schema for the original json output is provided by default.
  To enable the new schema, you must provide the `--no-legacy` in the command line.
- `FileObject.data` (and `FileObject.file_data`) has been set to a read-only attribute. 
- Updated parser testing to support the new metadata schema. To use, provide the `--no-legacy` flag to
the `mwcp test` command.
  - Created a new command line tool `mwcp_update_legacy_tests` to update your existing test cases to use the new metadata schema. (See [documentation](/docs/ParserTesting.md#updating-legacy-test-cases))
  - New parser test cases now use pytest.
- Updated text report display and added markdown and html formats.
  - Also added file tree display at the end of the report (for some formats).
- Updated csv output.
- Results from `Parser.identify()` are now cached to prevent repeated processing of the same file.


### Deprecated
- `FileObject.file_path` is planned to be changed to only be a non-None value if the `FileObject` 
instance is backed by a real file on the file system.
    - The creation of a temporary file path has been moved to `.temp_path()`.
- Adding metadata is now done using objects found in `mwcp.metadata`. The key/value approach is deprecated
  and support will be removed in a future major release.
- `mwcp.Reporter` object is deprecated in favor of using either `mwcp.Runner` or `mwcp.run()`.
- The `self.reporter` attribute in a parser has been renamed to `self.report` and is now a `mwcp.Report` object.
  - Interface is currently the same as `mwcp.Reporter`, so your code shouldn't break except for in extreme corner cases.
- The `.metadata` attribute in `mwcp.Reporter` (now called `mwcp.Report`) is deprecated in favor of using `.as_dict()`.
    - WARNING: A best attempt was done to keep the results of the `.metadata` attribute the same. However, due to new validation and type coercion mechanisms, you may run into corner cases where the results are slightly different, causing your parser test to fail. 
- The json schema as described in [fields.txt](mwcp/config/fields.txt) is deprecated in favor
of the schema described in [`mwcp.metadata`](mwcp/metadata.py).
- Providing a "reporter" argument to `FileObject.__init__()` is deprecated.
- `FileObject.output()` and `Reporter.output_file()` is deprecated in favor of adding a `mwcp.metadata.ResidualFile` object to `Report.add()`.
- Using `FileObject.file_path` to get a temporary file path is deprecated in favor of using `.temp_path()`, which is now a context manager.
    - (This change is to ensure we have more guaranteed cleanup of temporary files.)
- `Reporter.managed_tempdir` is deprecated. Instead, the developer should properly create and destroy a temporary directory themselves using Python's builtin library. However, it is best to use `FileObject.temp_path()` or reevaluate if there is a way parsing can be accomplished without writing out a file to the file system if possible.
- The `-i` flag is no longer supported. Input file information will now always be provided (with the exception of legacy JSON output).
- Using a `FileObject` instance in a `with` statement directly to get a file stream is now deprecated. Please use `FileObject.open()` instead.
- `FileObject.file_data` is deprecated in favor of `FileObject.data`.
- `FileObject.file_name` is deprecated in favor of `FileObject.name`.

- Changed log messages for file identification and misidentification to update phrasing for parsing groups vs parsing components. (@ddash-ct)
- Added support for importing external parser components/groups within a parser configuration. (See [documentation](docs/ParserInstallation.md#grouping-parsers))
- Added support for providing run configuration options to `FileObject.run_kordesii_decoder()` which will be passed 
    along to `kordesii.run_ida()` when calling IDA. (This allows you to provide the new `is_64bit` option if necessary.)

### Fixed
- Fixed glob pattern in Techanarchy wrapper. (@cccs-aa)
- Fixed misspelling of "Characteristics" in `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR`. (@ddash-ct)
- Fixed infinite loop that can be caused due to a sub-parser throwing an `UnableToParse` exception. (@ddash-ct)

**NOTE: This is the last version to support Python 2. 
The next release will only support Python 3.**

### Added
- Added `--force` flag to `Tester` for adding or updating testcases to ignore errors if set. (@ddash-ct)

longer cause the test case to be updated. This must be explicitly allowed by also adding the `--update` flag.
- Added `mwcp serve` command to run mwcp server.
- mwcp server is now implemented with Flask instead of Bottle.
    - If using the server as a WSGI app, the app instance must be created with

- Deprecated the use of `debug()` and `error()` functions in the Reporter class.
    - Parsers should use the ComponentParser's `logger` or create one at the top of your module.
- Deprecated `TerminatedString` in `construct` helpers. (Please use Padded with CString instead.)

- `pefileutils` helper utility
- `custombase64` helper utility
- Dispatcher model, which allows you to split up a parser by their components (Dropper, Implant, etc). (See [documentation](docs/DispatcherParserDevelopment.md) for more information.)
- Support for using setuptool's entry_points to allow for formal python packaging of parsers. (See [documentation](docs/ParserDevelopment.md#formal-parser-packaging) for more information.)
- Added ability to merge results from multiple parsers with the same name but different sources.

### Changed
- Replaced `enstructured` with a `construct` helper utility (See [migration guide](docs/construct.ipynb) for more information.)
