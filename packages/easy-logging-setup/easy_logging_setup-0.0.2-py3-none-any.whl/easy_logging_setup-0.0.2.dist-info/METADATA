# Easy Logging Package

Easy Logging is a Python package that simplifies the process of setting up logging in your Python applications. With Easy Logging, you can easily configure logging to suit your needs, without having to write a lot of boilerplate code.

## Installation

You can install Easy Logging using pip:

```bash
pip install easy-logging
```

# Usage
Here's an example of how you can use Easy Logging to configure logging in your Python application:

```python
# main.py
from easy_logging import EasyLogging, EasyLoggingSetup

# Configure logging for json mode 
EasyLoggingSetup(enable_json_mode=True)

# Get the logger for the current module
logger = EasyLogging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log messages
logger.debug('This is a debug message')
logger.info('This is an info message')
logger.warning('This is a warning message')
logger.error('This is an error message')
logger.critical('This is a critical message')
``` 

In this example, we import the Logging class from the easy_logging package and use it to configure logging. We can pass an optional enable_json_mode argument to the Logging class to enable JSON formatting for the log messages. We then use the getLogger method to get a logger object that we can use to log messages.

# Configuration
Easy Logging uses a YAML configuration file to configure logging. By default, the configuration file is located in the same directory as the easy_logging package. You can customize the configuration by creating a log-config.yml file in the same directory as your Python script and modifying the configuration as needed.
