TODO

## Things to remember (for the developer of this framework)

- **Different Promise and StreamedPromise resolvers, piece streamers, appenders and what not should always catch
  BaseExceptions and not just Exceptions** when they capture errors to pass those errors as "pieces" in order for
  those errors to be raised at the "consumer side". This is because many of the aforementioned Promising "primitives"
  are often part of mechanisms that involve communications between async tasks via asyncio.Queue objects and just
  interrupting those promises with KeyboardInterrupt which are extended from BaseException instead of letting
  KeyboardInterrupt to go through the queue leads to hanging of those promises (a queue is waiting for END_OF_QUEUE
  sentinel forever but the task that should send it is dead).
