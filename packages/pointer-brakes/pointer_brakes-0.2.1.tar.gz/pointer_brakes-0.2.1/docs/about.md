## Why did you make this?

The short answer is there are no Python libraries for simulating the mouse cursor behavior of a trackball mouse.

The long answer is I have wrist injuries which require I immobilize my wrists when working.  This means I am restricted to [ergo keyboards](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/) and [thumb trackball mice](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html).  The keyboard is great; however the trackball mice stinks. I'm absolutely tired of the inconsistency in movement and constant cleaning.

Wouldn't it be nice if I could just _purchase_ a thumb trackpad mouse which acts like a thumb trackball mouse?  Well, they don't exist so I'll have to make one myself.  To complete this task I've chosen to go the [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) route.  Thus, here we are creating a library to handle the pointer motion simulation
