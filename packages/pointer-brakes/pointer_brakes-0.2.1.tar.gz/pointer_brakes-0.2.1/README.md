-----

Pointer Brakes is a library for simulating mouse pointer motion.  The pointer will behave like it is a little car with brakes.  If you push it, it moves.  If you let go, it keeps moving but slowly comes to a stop as it applies the brakes.

## Installation

```console
pip install pointer-brakes
```

## Usage

__**NOTE**__ Windows users should prefer `time.time_ns()` as the resolution is very poor on `time.monotonic_ns()`

```python
a_brakes = 1
sim_instance = PointerMotionSim(a_brakes)
sim_instance.tick(time.monotonic_ns(), (-52, -5)) 
sim_instance.tick(time.monotonic_ns(), (21, -92))
change_in_position = sim_instance.delta_position
```
