# Lucy

Lucy, a CLI companion for competitive programming on AtCoder and Codeforces, frees you from tedious
tasks. It automatically fetches sample tests, sets up directories, and lets you test your code with
just a few commands, streamlining your workflow and letting you focus on writing brilliant
solutions.

## Installation
```
pip install lucy01
```

## Environment Variables
- `LUCY_HOME`

    Specify home directory for `lucy`.

## Configuration
Lucy supports the following configuration options which can be accessed using the `config` command
group:

- `AtCoder.UserId`, `AtCoder.Password`

    AtCoder login credentials. Required to perform tasks which require signing in such as setting up
    an **ongoing** contest.

- `NThreads`

    Default threads of execution to be used when setting up a contest. `4` seems to be a good
    choice.

## Getting Started
1. Set the environment variable `$LUCY_HOME` as preferred. By default, it uses the `~/.lucy`.
2. Get help!
    ```
    lucy --help
    ```
    Check out the [documentation](https://lucy01.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- Lucy organizes your competitive programming workspace with a clear directory structure. Besides folders for specific contests and their solutions with `tests`, a key element is the `common` directory. This folder stores reusable code snippets `(*.cpp)`. These snippets can be easily inserted into your solution files using filename prefixes thanks to the `cp.code-snippets` file in the `.vscode` folder. This file, automatically generated with `lucy update-snippets`,  facilitates code completion within Visual Studio Code.
