A powerful tool that allows you to add custom attributes and variables to your pytest tests. 

With this plugin, you can easily attach additional data to each test, which can then be referenced by fixtures or even the test itself.
This enables you to create more flexible and dynamic test suites tailored to your specific needs.


Features
--------

- Custom Attributes for Tests: Add custom attributes to individual tests using the @attributes marker, allowing you to store important metadata or configuration data directly with the test.

- Access Attributes in Fixtures: Easily access attribute values within fixtures, enabling you to create dynamic fixtures that adapt to the specific requirements of each test.

- Reference Attributes in Tests: Directly access attribute values within the test functions themselves, providing a convenient way to parameterize tests, perform conditional logic, or customize test behavior based on the attached attributes.


Installation
------------

```bash
pip install pytest-attributes
```


Usage
-----

In the directory where you will be running your pytest, create a file called "pytest_custom_outputs.json".
You will use this file to create your own custom outputs.
Feel free to copy and paste the below json file into yours and edit from there.

EXAMPLE FILE:
```python
{
        "custom_outputs": {
                "Pass_with_exception": {
                        "desc":"passed_with_exception",
                        "code":"P",
                        "tag":"XPASSED",
                        "color":"green"
                },
                "Fatal_failed": {
                        "desc":"fatal_failed",
                        "code":"!",
                        "tag":"FAILED",
                        "color":"red"
                },
                "Not_available": {
                        "desc":"not_available",
                        "code":"N",
                        "tag":"NOT_AVAILABLE",
                        "color":"blue"
                },
                "Failed_but_proceed": {
                        "desc":"failed_but_proceed",
                        "code":"X",
                        "tag":"FAILED_BUT_PROCEED",
                        "color":"red"
                },
                "Unimplemented": {
                        "desc":"unimplemented",
                        "code":"U",
                        "tag":"UNIMPLEMENTED",
                        "color":"yellow"
                },
                "Skipped": {
                        "desc":"skipped",
                        "code":"S",
                        "tag":"SKIPPED",
                        "color":"yellow"
                }
        }
}

```


custom_outputs
 - A dictionary with all the custom outputs inside of it. You can edit, delete, and add new outputs here.

Each custom output is denoted by a name. The name is also the key for that output
For example, in the above example file, "Pass_with_exception" and "Fatal_failed" are the names for their respective output.
Names are also how we determine the result of a test case. 
We use the c_assert function and enter the name as an argument to assert that specific output.

For example:
```python
import pytest
from pytest_custom_outputs import c_assert

def test_1():
    c_assert("Pass_with_exception")
```

In the example above, test_1 will result in "passed_with_exception".

If we put a name that is not in our custom output in the c_assert parameter, then it will assert the unknown outcome
Because of this, it is recommended to not make a custom output with the name "unknown"

The rest of the information in the json file can be edited and customized to your liking.
