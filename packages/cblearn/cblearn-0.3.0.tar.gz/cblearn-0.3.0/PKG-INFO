## Comparison-based Machine Learning in Python
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cblearn.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cblearn)
[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cblearn/badge/?version=stable)](https://cblearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable)
[![Test status](https://github.com/cblearn/cblearn/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/cblearn/cblearn/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/cblearn/cblearn/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=P9JRT6OK6O)](https://codecov.io/gh/cblearn/cblearn)

Comparison-based learning methods are machine learning algorithms using similarity comparisons ("A and B are more similar than C and D") instead of featurized data. 


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

from cblearn.datasets import make_random_triplets
from cblearn.embedding import SOE
from cblearn.metrics import QueryScorer

X = load_iris().data
triplets = make_random_triplets(X, result_format="list-order", size=1000)

estimator = SOE(n_components=2)
# Measure the fit with scikit-learn's cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(estimator, triplets, cv=5)
print(f"The 5-fold CV triplet error is {sum(scores) / len(scores)}.")

# Estimate the scale on all triplets
embedding = estimator.fit_transform(triplets)
print(f"The embedding has shape {embedding.shape}.")
```

## Related packages

There are more Python packages for comparison-based learning:

- [metric-learn](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn) is a collection of algorithms for metric learning. The *weakly supervised* algorithms learn from triplets and quadruplets.
- [salmon](https://docs.stsievert.com/salmon/) is a package for efficiently collecting triplets in crowd-sourced experiments. The package implements ordinal embedding algorithms and sampling strategies to query the most informative comparisons actively.
