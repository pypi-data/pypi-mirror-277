Car Similarity dataset
-----------------------

`This dataset contains triplets`_ of 60 car images, responsed in an online survey.
The people chose one car of three, such that the following statement is true:
"Object A is the most central object within the triple of objects (A,B,C)".

All images were found on Wikimedia Commons and are assigned to one of four classes:
ORDINARY CARS, SPORTS CARS, OFF-ROAD/SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES, and OUTLIERS.

The corresponding car images are available here in the `full dataset`_.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    ===================   =====================
    Triplets                               7097
    Objects (Cars)                           60
    Query                  3 cars, most-central
    ===================   =====================

This dataset can be downloaded using the :func:`cblearn.datasets.fetch_car_similarity`.
To use the most-central triplets with e.g. ordinal embedding algorithms, you should convert them to standard triplets
(:func:`cblearn.dataset.triplets_from_mostcentral`).
