These datasets can be downloaded using the :func:`cblearn.datasets.fetch_similarity_matrix` with the
corresponding name parameter. Triplet trials can be generated by using 1 - the similarity matrix as a precomputed
distance matrix: `cblearn.dataset.make_random_triplets(1 - data.similarity, distance='precomputed')`.
