Things Similarity dataset
-------------------------

`This dataset`_ contains odd-one-out trials of images from the Things image database.
In an crowd sourced experiments, subjects were asked to choose one of three images, that is the odd-one.
Note: The trials used here, are the test trials of the original paper. Their train trials are not published.

The data is shared under CC-BY-4.0 by Hebart, M. N., Zheng, C. Y., Pereira, F., and Baker, C. I.

This dataset can be downloaded using the :func:`cblearn.datasets.fetch_things_similarity`.
To use the odd-one-out trials with e.g. ordinal embedding algorithms, they can be converted to standard triplets
with :func:`cblearn.preprocessing.triplets_from_oddoneout`.
