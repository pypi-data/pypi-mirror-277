class Sensor:
    """Example details of the camera system.  This is not intended to be a
    complete list but is more than adequate for the NIIRS demo (see
    pybsm.metrics.functional.niirs).

    :param name:
        name of the sensor
    :param D:
        effective aperture diameter (m)
    :param f:
        focal length (m)
    :param px:
        detector center-to-center spacings (pitch) in the x and y directions
        (meters); if py is not provided, it is assumed equal to px
    :param optTransWavelengths:
        specifies the spectral bandpass of the camera (m); at minimum, specify
        a start and end wavelength
    :param opticsTransmission:
        full system in-band optical transmission (unitless); do not include loss
        due to any telescope obscuration in this optical transmission array
    :param eta:
        relative linear obscuration (unitless); obscuration of the aperture
        commonly occurs within telescopes due to secondary mirror or spider
        supports
    :param py:
        detector center-to-center spacings (pitch) in the x and y directions
        (meters); if py is not provided, it is assumed equal to px
    :param wx:
        detector width in the x and y directions (m); if set equal to px and
        py, this corresponds to an assumed full pixel fill factor. In general,
        wx and wy are less than px and py due to non-photo-sensitive area
        (typically transistors) around each pixel.
    :param wy:
        detector width in the x and y directions (m); if set equal to px and
        py, this corresponds to an assumed full pixel fill factor. In general,
        wx and wy are less than px and py due to non-photo-sensitive area
        (typically transistors) around each pixel.
    :param intTime:
        maximum integration time (s)
    :param qe:
        quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength (e-/photon)
    :param qewavelengths:
        wavelengths corresponding to the array qe (m)
    :param otherIrradiance:
        spectral irradiance from other sources (W/m^2 m); this is particularly
        useful for self emission in infrared cameras and may also represent
        stray light.
    :param darkCurrent:
        detector dark current (e-/s); dark current is the relatively small
        electric current that flows through photosensitive devices even when no
        photons enter the device
    :param maxN:
        detector electron well capacity (e-); the default 100 million
        initializes to a large number so that, in the absence of better
        information, it doesn't affect outcomes
    :param bitdepth:
        resolution of the detector ADC in bits (unitless); default of 100 is a
        sufficiently large number so that in the absence of better information,
        it doesn't affect outcomes
    :param ntdi:
        number of TDI stages (unitless)
    :param coldshieldTemperature:
        temperature of the cold shield (K); it is a common approximation to
        assume that the coldshield is at the same temperature as the detector
        array
    :param opticsTemperature:
        temperature of the optics (K)
    :param opticsEmissivity:
        emissivity of the optics (unitless) except for the cold filter;
        a common approximation is 1-optics transmissivity
    :param coldfilterTransmission:
        transmission through the cold filter (unitless)
    :param coldfilterTemperature:
        temperature of the cold filter; it is a common approximation to assume
        that the filter is at the same temperature as the detector array
    :param coldfilterEmissivity:
        emissivity through the cold filter (unitless); a common approximation
        is 1-cold filter transmission
    :param sx:
        root-mean-squared jitter amplitudes in the x direction (rad)
    :param sy:
        root-mean-squared jitter amplitudes in the y direction (rad)
    :param dax:
        line-of-sight angular drift rate during one integration time in the x
        direction (rad/s)
    :param day:
        line-of-sight angular drift rate during one integration time in the y
        direction (rad/s)
    :param pv:
        wavefront error phase variance (rad^2) -- tip: write as (2*pi*waves of
        error)^2
    :param pvwavelength:
        wavelength at which pv is obtained (m)
