## CLI Usage

```
Usage: ibi [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Library and CLI for generating installation instructions from json schema
  and jinja templates.

Options:
  --version   Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  install  Installs with config and parameters given.
  show     Shows installation instructions for your specified config file...
```

Options are dynamically created with the schema part of the config file.   

> [!TIP]
> Show help for a config file with: `ibi show CONFIG_FILE --help`.


## Config

* The config is comprised of a single file `install.cfg`.
* The config has two parts delimited by `------` (6 or more `-`).
* Both parts should be developed in different files for language server support.


### Schema

* The first section of the config is a [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/).
* It can be written in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) or to JSON capabilites restricted [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
* When creating a schema use the following schema draft version: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
* `title` are used for pretty print option names.
* `description` is used for the options help message.
* `anyOf` with nested `const` and `title` are a special case as a replacement for `enum` but with pretty print name.


### Template

* You can have as much whitespace and line breaks as you wish in and inbetween your commands.
* Commands must be seperated by `&&`! (`pip install installation-instruction && pip uninstall installation-instruction`.)
* If you wish to stop the render from within the template you can use the macro `raise`. (`{{ raise("no support!") }}`.) 


### MISC

Please have a look at the [examples](./examples/).
