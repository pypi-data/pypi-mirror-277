def test_sphinx():
    """
    This is a placeholder function that allows testing of the sphinx documentation format.
    This function doesn't do anything, so don't worry.

    The folder tree for setting up looks as follows (using attached attribute
    names rather than paths):

    inline code can be written like :code:`val = number`

    Title
    =====

    Titles are underlined (or over- and underlined) with
    a nonalphanumeric character at least as long as the
    text.

    A lone top-level section is lifted up to be the
    document's title.

    Any non-alphanumeric character can be used, but
    Python convention is:

    * ``#`` with overline, for parts
    * ``*`` with overline, for chapters
    * ``=``, for sections
    * ``-``, for subsections
    * ``^``, for subsubsections
    * ``"``, for paragraphs

    This is a conceptual class representation of a simple BLE device
    (GATT Server). It is essentially an extended combination of the
    :class:`bluepy.btle.Peripheral` and :class:`bluepy.btle.ScanEntry` classes

    :param client: A handle to the :class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient` client
        object that detected the device
    :type client: class:`simpleble.SimpleBleClient`
    :param addr: Device MAC address, defaults to None
    :type addr: str, optional
    :param addrType: Device address type - one of ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC or
        ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM, defaults to ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC
    :type addrType: str, optional
    :param iface: Bluetooth interface number (0 = /dev/hci0) used for the
        connection, defaults to 0
    :type iface: int, optional
    :param data: A list of tuples (adtype, description, value) containing the
        AD type code, human-readable description and value for all available
        advertising data items, defaults to None
    :type data: list, optional
    :param rssi: Received Signal Strength Indication for the last received
        broadcast from the device. This is an integer value measured in dB,
        where 0 dB is the maximum (theoretical) signal strength, and more
        negative numbers indicate a weaker signal, defaults to 0
    :type rssi: int, optional
    :param connectable: `True` if the device supports connections, and `False`
        otherwise (typically used for advertising ‘beacons’).,
        defaults to `False`
    :type connectable: bool, optional
    :param updateCount: Integer count of the number of advertising packets
        received from the device so far, defaults to 0
    :type updateCount: int, optional
