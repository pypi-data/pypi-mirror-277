# bd_sig_filter - v1.5
BD Script to ignore components matched from Signature scan likely to be partial or invalid matches.

## INTRODUCTION
Black Duck Signature matching is a unique and powerful way to find OSS and 3rd party code within your applications and
environments.

Signature matching uses hierarchical folder analysis to find matches with depth, identifying the most likely components
matching the project by examining all files in all folders as a whole.
Many competitive SCA solutions use individual file matching for files in the project, but this is not suitable 
to identify component matches because the majority of files in components do not change between versions, 
so multiple version matches will be identified for every file. It is therefore impossible to infer an overall component
version by looking at the individual files.

However, Signature matching can still produce false positive matches, especially where template code hierarchies 
exist in custom and OSS code.

Furthermore, Signature matches can be identified in folders created by Synopsys tools, or in cache/config
locations or test folders; these folders can be ignored at scan time, but can exist in the Black Duck project and need to 
be removed after scan completion. Additionally, when scanning
modified OSS, Signature scanning can identify the same component with multiple versions from a single project
location, with the need to curate the BOM to ignore duplicate components.

This script uses several techniques to examine the Signature match paths for components, searching for the component
name and version in the path to determine matches which are likely correct and optionally marking them as reviewed.

It can also ignore components only matched from paths which should be excluded (Synopsys tools, cache/config folders 
and test folders), and components which are duplicates across versions where the version string is not found
in the signature match path or one match is a dependency.

Options are available to enable ignore and review actions, and other features.

## PREREQUISITES
Python 3.8+ must be installed prior to using this script.

## INSTALLATION
The package can be installed using the command:

    python3 -m pip install bd-sig-filter

Upgrade from a previous version using:

    python3 -m pip install bd-sig-filter --upgrade

Alternatively, the repository can be cloned and the script run directly using the command:

    python3 bd_sig_filter/bd_sig_filter.py OPTIONS

## USAGE
If installed as a package, run the utility using the command `bd-sig-filter`.

Alternatively if you have cloned the repo, use a command similar to:

    python3 bd_sig_filter/bd_sig_filter.py OPTIONS

The package can be invoked as follows:

    usage: bd-sig-filter [-h] [--blackduck_url BLACKDUCK_URL] [--blackduck_api_token BLACKDUCK_API_TOKEN] [--blackduck_trust_cert] [-p PROJECT] [-v VERSION] [--debug] [--logfile LOGFILE]

                         [--ignore_no_path_matches]

    options:

The minimum required options are:
    
    --blackduck_url https://BLACKDUCK_SERVER_URL
    --blackduck_api_token BLACKDUCK_API_TOKEN
    --project PROJECT
    --version VERSION

Environment variables BLACKDUCK_URL, BLACKDUCK_API_TOKEN and BLACKDUCK_TRUST_CERT may also be used.

## SCRIPT BEHAVIOUR
The default behaviour of the script is to create a table of BOM components with details about what actions can be taken.
By default, no actions will be taken, with only the tables being created to explain what would happen if `--ignore` and `--review`
options were specified.

An example of the output table is shown below:

    SUMMARY:
              Components    Ignored    Reviewed    Neither
    ------  ------------  ---------  ----------  ---------
    Before           641          0           0        641
    After            641         24         615          2

Note component names are truncated at 25 characters.

The `Before` and `After` rows in the SUMMARY list the total number of components, and how many components would be ignored or
marked reviewed by the script (if the `--ignore` and `--review` options are supplied).

The list of components shows the name, matchtypes and current ignore/review statuses, with the future status
(after running the script with the `--ignore` and `--review` options) in the `To Be Ignored` and `To Be Reviewed` 
columns with an explanation in the `Action` column.

The following options can be specified:

    --ignore:               Ignore components as shown in the `To Be Ignored` column
    --review:               Mark components as reviewed as shown in the `To Be Reviewed` column
    --no_ignore_test:       Do not ignore components with signature paths within test folders
    --no_ignore_synopsys:   Do not ignore components with signature paths within Synopsys tools folders (for example '.synopsys')
    --no_ignore_defaults:   Do not ignore components with signature paths in cache/config folders (for example '.git', '.m2', '.local')
    --version_match_required:
                            Enforce search for component version string in signature paths for marking reviewed
                            (Paths containing only the component name will be used for matching otherwise)
    --ignore_no_path_matches:
                            Components with no match in the signature path are left unreviewed by default, allowing
                            manual review. Use this option to ignore these components instead but use with caution
                            as it may exclude components which are legitimate (the Signature match path does not
                            have to include the component name or version).

The options `--report_file` and `--logfile` can be used to output the tabular report and logging data to
specified files.

## PROPOSED WORKFLOW
The script can classify Signature scan results.

It can mark components as reviewed which are either Dependencies, or which have signature match paths containing
the component name (and optionally component version) and which are therefore highly likely to be correctly identified
by Signature matching. Fuzzy pattern matching is used so there is the possibility
that components could be marked as reviewed where only a partial match exists, or components which should be matched
are not identified meaning that some manual curation may still be required.

It will also ignore components only matched within extraneous folders (for example created by Synopsys tools, 
config/cache folders or test folders).

Components shown with `No action` are Signature matches where the component name or version 
could not be identified in the signature paths, so they are potential false matches and require manual review.
Specify the `--ignore_no_path_matches` option to ignore these components automatically,
however this should be used with caution as these components may be valid and should be manually reviewed.

## PROCESSING DUPLICATE COMPONENTS
The script processes multiple versions of the same component in the BOM in several ways as described below:

### SCENARIO 1
- Comp1 and Comp2 are different versions of the same component
- Comp1 and Comp2 are BOTH dependencies

Outcome:
- Comp1 will be marked REVIEWED
- Comp2 will be marked REVIEWED

### SCENARIO 2
- Comp1 and Comp2 are different versions of the same component
- Comp1 is a dependency and Comp2 is a signature match
- Comp2 name IS found but version string is NOT found in the Signature match paths

Outcome:
- Comp1 will be marked REVIEWED
- Comp2 will be marked IGNORED

### SCENARIO 3
- Comp1 and Comp2 are different versions of the same component
- Comp1 is a dependency and Comp2 is a signature match
- Comp2 name and version strings ARE found in the Signature match paths

Outcome:
- Comp1 will be marked REVIEWED
- Comp2 will be left unignored and not marked reviewed - for manual review

### SCENARIO 4
- Comp1 and Comp2 are different versions of the same component
- Comp1 and Comp2 are both signature matches
- Comp1 name and version strings ARE both found in the Signature match paths
- Comp2 name IS found but version string is NOT found in the Signature match paths

Outcome:
- Comp1 will be marked REVIEWED
- Comp2 will be IGNORED

### SCENARIO 5
- Comp1 and Comp2 are different versions of the same component
- Comp1 and Comp2 are both signature matches
- Comp1 name string IS found but version string is NOT found in the Signature match paths
- Comp2 name string IS found but version string is NOT found in the Signature match paths

Outcome:
- Comp1 will be marked REVIEWED
- Comp2 will be left unignored and not reviewed - for manual review
