class SphericalHarmonics(BasisSet):
    """ Basis set class for spherical harmonics, the canonical representation
    of polynomials on the unit sphere and a simple way of representing
    band-limited spherical functions which allows for easy computations of statistics
    and is suitable for analyzing certain symmetries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ell_max : int
        The bandlimit of the spherical functions that you want to be able to represent.
        A good rule of thumb is that :attr:`ell_max` should not exceed the
        number of detector segments minus 1.
    probed_coordinates : ProbedCoordinates
        Optional. A container with the coordinates on the sphere probed at each detector segment by the
        experimental method. Its construction from the system geometry is method-dependent.
        By default, an empty instance of
        :class:`ProbedCoordinates <mumott.core.probed_coordinates.ProbedCoordinates>` is created.
    enforce_friedel_symmetry : bool
        If set to ``True``, Friedel symmetry will be enforced, using the assumption that points
        on opposite sides of the sphere are equivalent. This results in only even ``ell`` being used.
    kwargs
        Miscellaneous arguments which relate to segment integrations can be
        passed as keyword arguments:

            integration_mode
                 Mode to integrate line segments on the reciprocal space sphere. Possible options are
                 ``'simpson'``, ``'midpoint'``, ``'romberg'``, ``'trapezoid'``.
                 ``'simpson'``, ``'trapezoid'``, and ``'romberg'`` use adaptive
                 integration with the respective quadrature rule from ``scipy.integrate``.
                 ``'midpoint'`` uses a single mid-point approximation of the integral.
                 Default value is ``'simpson'``.
            n_integration_starting_points
                 Number of points used in the first iteration of the adaptive integration.
                 The number increases by the rule ``N`` &larr; ``2 * N - 1`` for each iteration.
                 Default value is 3.
            integration_tolerance
                 Tolerance for the maximum relative error between iterations before the integral
                 is considered converged. Default is ``1e-5``.
            integration_maxiter
                 Maximum number of iterations. Default is ``10``.

        Instead, one must either take the gradient of the residual between the
        :meth:`~.SphericalHarmonics.forward` computation of the coefficients and the data.
        Alternatively one can apply both the forward and the gradient computation to the
        coefficients to be optimized, and the gradient computation to the data, and treat
        the residual of the two as the gradient of the optimization coefficients. The approaches

        Notes
        -----
            The canonical inner product in a spherical harmonic representation
            is :math:`\sum_\ell N(\ell) \sum_m u_m^\ell v_m^\ell`, where :math:`N(\ell)` is
            a normalization constant (which is unity for the :math:`4\pi` normalization).
            This inner product is a rotational invariant. The rotational invariance also holds
            for any partial sums over :math:`\ell`.
            One can define a function of :math:`\ell` that returns such
            products, namely :math:`S(\ell, u, v) = N(\ell)\sum_m u_m^\ell v_m^\ell`,
            called the spectral power function.
            The sum :math:`\sum_{\ell = 1}S(\ell)` is equal to the covariance of the
            band-limited spherical functions represented by :math:`u` and :math:`v`, and each
            :math:`S(\ell, u, v)` is the contribution to the covariance of the band :math:`\ell`.
            See also
            `the SHTOOLS documentation <https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/real-spherical-harmonics.html>`_
            for an excellent overview of this.

        Parameters
        ----------
        u
            The first coefficient array, of arbitrary shape and dimension,
            except the last dimension must be the same as the length of
            :attr:`~.SphericalHarmonics.ell_indices`.
        v
            The second coefficient array, of the same shape as ``u``.
        resolve_spectrum
            Optional. Whether to resolve the product according to each frequency band, given by the
            coefficients of each ``ell`` in :attr:`~SphericalHarmonics.ell_indices`.
            Defaults to ``False``, which means that the sum of every component of the spectrum is returned.
            If ``True``, components are returned in order of ascending ``ell``.
            The ``ell`` included in the spectrum depends on :attr:`spectral_moments`.
        spectral_moments
            Optional. List of particular values of ``ell`` to calculate the inner product for.
            Defaults to ``None``, which is identical to including all values of ``ell``
            in the calculation.
            If :attr:`spectral_moments` contains all nonzero values of ``ell`` and
            :attr:`resolve_spectrum` is ``False``, the covariance of
            :attr:`v` and :attr:`u` will be calculated (the sum of the inner product over all non-zero ``ell``
            If ``resolve_spectrum`` is ``True``, the covariance per `ell` in ``spectral_moments``, will
            be calculated, i.e., the inner products will not be summed over.

                A copy of :attr:`~.SphericalHarmonics.projection_matrix`.
        spherical_functions
            means
                The spherical means of each function represented by :attr:`coefficients`.
            variances
                The spherical variances of each function represented by :attr:`coefficients`.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, all variances will equal zero.
            r2_tensors
                The traceless symmetric rank-2 tensor component of each function represented by
                :attr:`coefficients`, in 6-element form, in the order ``[xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy]``,
                i.e., by the Voigt convention.
                The matrix form can be recovered as r2_tensors[..., tensor_to_matrix_indices],
                yielding matrix elements ``[[xx, xy, xz], [xy, yy, yz], [xz, yz, zz]]``.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, all tensors have elements
                [1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0].
            tensor_to_matrix_indices
                A list of indices to help recover the matrix from the 2-element form of the
                rank-2 tensors, equalling precisely ``[[0, 5, 4], [5, 1, 3], [4, 3, 2]]``
            eigenvalues
                The eigenvalues of the rank-2 tensors, sorted in ascending order in the last index.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, the eigenvalues will always be (1, 0, -1)
            eigenvectors
                The eigenvectors of the rank-2 tensors, sorted with their corresponding eigenvectors
                in the last index. Thus, ``eigenvectors[..., 0]`` gives the eigenvector corresponding
                to the smallest eigenvalue, and ``eigenvectors[..., 2]`` gives the eigenvector
                corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. Generally, one of these two eigenvectors
                is used to define the orientation of a function, depending on whether it is
                characterized by a minimum (``0``) or a maximum (``2``). The middle eigenvector (``1``)
                is typically only used for visualizations.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, the eigenvectors will be the Cartesian basis
                vectors.
            main_orientations
                The estimated main orientations from the largest absolute eigenvalues.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, the main orientation will be the x-axis.
            main_orientation_symmetries
                The strength or definiteness of the main orientation, calculated from
                the quotient of the absolute middle and signed largest eigenvalues of the
                rank-2 tensor.
                If ``0``, the orientation is totally ambiguous. The orientation is completely
                transversal if the value is ``-1`` (orientation represents a minimum),
                and completely longitudinal if the value is ``1`` (orientation represents a maximum).
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, the main orientations are all totally ambiguous.
            normalized_standard_deviations
                A relative measure of the overall anisotropy of the spherical functions. Equals
                :math:`\sqrt{\sigma^2 / \mu}`, where :math:`\sigma^2` is the variance
                and :math:`\mu` is the mean. The places where :math:`\mu=0` have been
                set to ``0``. If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, the normalized standard
                deviations will always be zero.
            power_spectra
                The spectral powers of each ``ell`` in :attr:`~.SphericalHarmonics.ell_indices`,
                for each spherical function, sorted in ascending ``ell``.
                If :attr:`~.ell_max` is ``0``, each function will have only one element, equal
                to the mean squared.
            power_spectra_ell
                An array containing the corresponding ``ell`` to each of the last indices
                in :attr:`power_spectra`. Equal to ``np.unique(ell_indices)``.
