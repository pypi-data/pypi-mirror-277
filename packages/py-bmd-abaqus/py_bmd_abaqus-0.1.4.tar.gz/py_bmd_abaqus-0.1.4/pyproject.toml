description = "Assign bone material properties to an finite element mesh in ABAQUS. This library was created in order to assign trabecular bone material property values to an ABAQUS CAE input mesh file (INP). This script uses the \"Pooled\" Morgan et al. Modulus-Density relationship - retrieved from DOI: 10.1016/s0021-9290(03)00071-x in order to calculate material modulus from density in g/cm^3. This tool also returns an array of element HU, density, or modulus values which can be used to easy evaluation of bone quality in the meshed region."
