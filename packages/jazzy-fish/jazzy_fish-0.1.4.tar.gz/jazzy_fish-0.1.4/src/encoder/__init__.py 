Encoder
=======

This package contains the code required by clients who wish to generate jazzy-fish word sequences.

Modules:
    encoder - Contains the WordEncoder class that can encode integers to [word sequences]
              and decode [word sequences] to integers.
    generator - Contains the Generator and ThreadSafeGenerator classes which can generate unique integer identifiers
                that respect the configured settings and can be later converted to [word sequences] with a WordEncoder.
