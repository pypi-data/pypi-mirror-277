## Welcome!

As the name implies,
the `RIMSSchemeDrawer` is a tool to draw resonance ionization schemes.
The goal of this package is to create a publication-ready figure.

The easiest way to use the software is via a graphical user interface (GUI).
However, the software can also be used as a library.
Please see the [API documentation](api/index.md) for more information.

## Next steps

Please check out the [installation guide](install.md) to get started.
While the GUI is fairly self-explanatory
and includes many tool-tips to help you navigate,
you might also want to check out the [how-to guide](gui.md).

## Issues/Enhancements

If you run into any problems with the software
or have ideas for enhancements,
please raise an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/RIMS-Code/RIMSSchemeDrawer/issues).
