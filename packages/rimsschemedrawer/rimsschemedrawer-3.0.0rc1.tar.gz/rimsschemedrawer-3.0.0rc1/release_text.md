Release of RIMSSchemeDrawer `v3.0.0rc1`

This is the first release candidate for the new version of the RIMSSchemeDrawer.
It should be fully compatible with the previous version's config files, however, discrepancies might occur since the ionization potential is now coded into the drawer itself and cannot be user selected anymore. Be aware of changes.

Currently, executables for Linux, Windows, and MacOS are published, however, these are not installers yet. The full release will include installers that place the program nicely for you.
