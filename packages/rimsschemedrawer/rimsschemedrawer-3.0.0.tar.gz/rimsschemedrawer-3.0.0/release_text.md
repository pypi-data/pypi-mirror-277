Release of RIMSSchemeDrawer `v3.0.0`

This is the new RIMSSchemeDrawer `v3.0.0` release. The main user features that are new are the following:

- Figures can be plotted in light and dark mode with transparent or solid backgrounds (useful for presentations).
- The ionization potential is automatically filled and not anymore user supplied. For details on ionization potential, see the [RIS database website](https://rims-code.github.io).
- Proper documentation of the program is available [here](https://rimsschemedrawer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Config files loading and saving are compatible with submitting schemes for the [RIS database website](https://rims-code.github.io).
- Lasers that were used can now be selected (mainly important for database submission).
- The program is not only available as a pre-packaged installer, but can also be installed directly from `pypi` (see [docs](https://rimsschemedrawer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)).

As always, if you find any issues, please report them and have fun with the new version.
