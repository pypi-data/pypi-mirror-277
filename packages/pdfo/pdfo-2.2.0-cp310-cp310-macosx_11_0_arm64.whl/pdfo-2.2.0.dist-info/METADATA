## Introduction

PDFO (Powell's Derivative-Free Optimization solvers) is a cross-platform package
providing interfaces for using the late Professor [M. J. D. Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html)
derivative-free optimization solvers, including UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA,
and COBYLA. See the [PDFO homepage](https://www.pdfo.net) and the [PDFO paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13246.pdf) for more information.

This package makes use of a modified version of [Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html)
Fortran code. See the folder [`original`](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo/tree/main/fsrc/original)
under `fsrc` for [Powell's](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) original code.

## Python version of PDFO

### Installation

#### Recommended installation

To use the Python version of PDFO on Linux, Mac, or Windows, you need
[Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or above).

It is highly recommended to install PDFO via [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) in your system if
you Python version does not include it. Then execute

```bash
pip install pdfo
```

in a command shell (e.g., the terminal for Linux and macOS, or the Command
Shell for Windows). If your pip launcher is not `pip`, adapt the
command accordingly (it may be `pip3` for example). If this
command runs successfully, PDFO is installed. You may verify the
installation by

```bash
python -m unittest pdfo.testpdfo
```

Once again, if your Python launcher is not `python`, adapt the command accordingly (it may be `python3` for example).
If you are an Anaconda user, PDFO is also available through the conda installer
( https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdfo ). However, it is not managed by us.

#### Alternative installation (using source distribution)

Alternatively, although deeply discouraged, PDFO can be installed from the
source code. It requires you to install additional Python headers, a Fortran
compiler (e.g., [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)), and
[F2PY](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/) (provided by
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)).
Download and decompress the [source code package](https://www.pdfo.net/docs.html#download),
or clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/pdfo/pdfo).
You will obtain a folder containing `pyproject.toml`; in a command shell,
change your directory to this folder; then install PDFO by executing

```bash
pip install .
```

### Usage

PDFO provides a Python function `pdfo`, which can solve general constrained or unconstrained optimization problems without using derivatives.

The `pdfo` function can automatically identify the type of your problem and then call one of Powellâ€™s solvers, namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.
The user can also specify the solver by setting the `method` field of the options passed to `pdfo`.

The `pdfo` function is designed to be compatible with the [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize) function of [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). You can call pdfo in exactly the same way as calling [scipy.optimize.minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize) except that `pdfo` does not accept derivative arguments.

For the detailed syntax of `pdfo`, use the standard `help` command
of Python:

```python
from pdfo import pdfo
help(pdfo)
```

### Uninstall

PDFO can be uninstalled by executing the following command in a command shell:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall pdfo
```

## MATLAB version of PDFO

### Prerequisites

PDFO supports MATLAB R2014a and later releases. To use PDFO, you need first
set up the [MEX](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html) of your
MATLAB so that it can compile Fortran.
**The setup of MEX is a pure MATLAB usage problem and it has nothing to do with PDFO.**

To see whether your MEX is ready, run the following code in MATLAB:

```matlab
mex('-setup', '-v', 'fortran'); mex('-v', fullfile(matlabroot, 'extern', 'examples', 'refbook', 'timestwo.F'));
```

If this completes successfully, then your MEX is ready. Otherwise, it is not, and
you may try the [`setup_mex` package](https://github.com/equipez/setup_mex) at
```
https://github.com/equipez/setup_mex
```
It will help you to set MEX up on Windows or macOS (the setup of MEX is trivial on Linux).
In case `setup_mex` does not work, you need to consult a local MATLAB expert or the technical support of
MathWorks about "[how to set up MEX](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html)", which is
**not** part of PDFO.

### Installation

Download and decompress the [source code package](https://www.pdfo.net/docs.html#download),
or clone it from [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/pdfo/pdfo).
You will obtain a folder containing `setup.m`. Place this folder at the location
where you  want PDFO to be installed. In MATLAB, change the directory to this
folder, and execute the following command:

```matlab
setup
```

If this command runs successfully, PDFO is installed. You may execute the
following command in MATLAB to verify the installation:

```matlab
testpdfo
```

### Usage

PDFO provides a MATLAB function `pdfo`, which can solve general constrained or unconstrained optimization problems without using derivatives.

The `pdfo` function can automatically identify the type of your problem and then call one of Powellâ€™s solvers, namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.
The user can also specify the solver by setting the `solver` field of the options passed to `pdfo`.

The `pdfo` function is designed to be compatible with the `fmincon` function available in the [Optimization Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html) of MATLAB.
You can call `pdfo` in the same way as calling `fmincon`. In addition, `pdfo` can be called in some flexible ways that are not supported by `fmincon`.

For detailed syntax of `pdfo`, use the standard `help` command
of MATLAB:

```matlab
help pdfo
```


### Uninstall

PDFO can be uninstalled using the setup.m script by executing the following
command in MATLAB:

```matlab
setup uninstall
```

## Citing PDFO

**Remark:** LINCOA seeks the least value of a nonlinear function subject to
linear inequality constraints without using derivatives of the objective
function. Powell did not publish a paper to introduce the algorithm.
