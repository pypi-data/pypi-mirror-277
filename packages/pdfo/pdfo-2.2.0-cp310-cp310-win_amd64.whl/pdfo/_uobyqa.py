def uobyqa(fun, x0, args=(), options=None):
    r"""Unconstrained Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation.

    .. deprecated:: 1.3
        Calling the UOBYQA solver via the `uobyqa` function is deprecated.
        The UOBYQA solver remains available in PDFO. Call the `pdfo` function
        with the argument ``method='uobyqa'`` to use it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Objective function to be minimized.

            ``fun(x, *args) -> float``

        where ``x`` is an array with shape (n,) and `args` is a tuple.
    x0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial guess.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments of the objective function. For example,

            ``uobyqa(fun, x0, args, ...)``

        is equivalent to

            ``uobyqa(lambda x: fun(x, *args), x0, ...)``

    options : dict, optional
        The options passed to the solver. Accepted options are:

            radius_init : float, optional
                Initial value of the trust-region radius. Typically, it should
                be in the order of one tenth of the greatest expected change to
                the variables.
            radius_final : float, optional
                Final value of the trust-region radius. It must be smaller than
                or equal to ``options['radius_init']`` and should indicate the
                accuracy required in the final values of the variables.
            maxfev : int, optional
                Maximum number of function evaluations.
            ftarget : float, optional
                Target value of the objective function. The optimization
                procedure is terminated when the objective function value of a
                point is less than or equal to this target.
            quiet: bool, optional
                Whether to suppress the output messages.
            classical : bool, optional
                Whether to use the classical version of Powell's method. It is
                highly discouraged in production.
            debug : bool, optional
                Whether to perform debugging checks. It is highly discouraged in
                production.
            chkfunval : bool, optional
                Whether to check the value of the objective and constraint
                functions at the solution. This is only done in the debug mode,
                and requires one extra function evaluation. It is highly
                discouraged in production.

                Whether the optimization procedure terminated successfully.
            status : int
                Termination status of the optimization procedure.
            fun : float

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to solve a simple optimization problem using
    `uobyqa`. In practice, the  problem considered below should be solved with a
    derivative-based method as it is a smooth problem for which the derivatives
    are known. We solve it here using `uobyqa` only as an illustration.

    We consider the 2-dimensional problem

    .. math::

        \min_{x, y \in \R} \quad x^2 + y^2.

    We solve this problem using `uobyqa` starting from the initial guess
    :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (0, 1)` with at most 200 function evaluations.

    .. testsetup::

        import numpy as np
        np.set_printoptions(precision=1, suppress=True)

    >>> from pdfo import uobyqa
    >>>
    >>> # Solve the problem.
    >>> options = {'maxfev': 200}
    >>> res = uobyqa(lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2, [0, 1], options=options)
    >>> res.x
    array([0., 0.])
