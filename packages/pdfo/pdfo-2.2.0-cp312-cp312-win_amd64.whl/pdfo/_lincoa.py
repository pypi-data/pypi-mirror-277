        Calling the LINCOA solver via the `lincoa` function is deprecated.
        The LINCOA solver remains available in PDFO. Call the `pdfo` function
        with the argument ``method='lincoa'`` to use it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Objective function to be minimized.

            ``fun(x, *args) -> float``

        where ``x`` is an array with shape (n,) and `args` is a tuple.
    x0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial guess.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments of the objective function. For example,

            ``lincoa(fun, x0, args, ...)``

        is equivalent to

            ``lincoa(lambda x: fun(x, *args), x0, ...)``

    bounds : {`scipy.optimize.Bounds`, array_like, shape (n, 2)}, optional
        Bound constraints of the problem. It can be one of the cases below.

        #. An instance of `scipy.optimize.Bounds`.
        #. An array with shape (n, 2). The bound constraints for ``x[i]`` are
           ``bounds[i, 0] <= x[i] <= bounds[i, 1]``. Set ``bounds[i, 0]`` to
           :math:`-\infty` if there is no lower bound, and set ``bounds[i, 1]``
           to :math:`\infty` if there is no upper bound.

    constraints : {`scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint`, list}, optional
        Constraints of the problem. It can be one of the cases below.

        #. An instance of `scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint`.
        #. A list of instances of `scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint`.

    options : dict, optional
        The options passed to the solver. Accepted options are:

            radius_init : float, optional
                Initial value of the trust-region radius. Typically, it should
                be in the order of one tenth of the greatest expected change to
                the variables.
            radius_final : float, optional
                Final value of the trust-region radius. It must be smaller than
                or equal to ``options['radius_init']`` and should indicate the
                accuracy required in the final values of the variables.
            maxfev : int, optional
                Maximum number of function evaluations.
            ftarget : float, optional
                Target value of the objective function. The optimization
                procedure is terminated when the objective function value of a
                nearly feasible point is less than or equal to this target.
            npt : int, optional
                Number of interpolation points.
            quiet: bool, optional
                Whether to suppress the output messages.
            scale : bool, optional
                Whether to scale the problem according to the bound constraints.
            eliminate_lin_eq : bool, optional
                Whether to eliminate linear equality constraints.
            classical : bool, optional
                Whether to use the classical version of Powell's method. It is
                highly discouraged in production.
            debug : bool, optional
                Whether to perform debugging checks. It is highly discouraged in
                production.
            chkfunval : bool, optional
                Whether to check the value of the objective and constraint
                functions at the solution. This is only done in the debug mode,
                and requires one extra function evaluation. It is highly
                discouraged in production.

    Returns
    -------
    res : `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult`
        Result of the optimization procedure, with the following fields:

            message : str
                Description of the exit status specified in the ``status``
                field (i.e., the cause of the termination of the solver).
            success : bool
                Whether the optimization procedure terminated successfully.
            status : int
                Termination status of the optimization procedure.
            fun : float
                Objective function value at the solution point.
            x : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (n,)
                Solution point.
            nfev : int
                Number of function evaluations.
            fun_history : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (nfev,)
                History of the objective function values.
            method : str
                Name of the Powell method used.

        For constrained problems, the following fields are also returned:

            maxcv : float
                Maximum constraint violation at the solution point.
            maxcv_history : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (nfev,)
                History of the maximum constraint violation.

        For linearly constrained problems, the following field is also returned:

            constraints : {`numpy.ndarray`, list}
                The values of the constraints at the solution point. If a single
                constraint is passed, i.e., if the `constraints` argument is a
                `scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint`, then the returned value is
                a `numpy.ndarray`, which is the value of the constraint at
                ``x``. Otherwise, it is a list of `numpy.ndarray`, each element
                being the value of a constraint at ``x``.

        This function attempts to detect the infeasibility of constraints
        (however, if no such infeasibility is detected, it does not mean that
        the problem is feasible). If the optimization procedure terminated
        because some constraints are infeasible (i.e., when the exit status is
        -4), the following fields may also be returned:

            infeasible_bounds : `numpy.ndarray`
                Indices of the bounds that are infeasible.
            infeasible_linear_constraints : `numpy.ndarray`
                Indices of the linear constraints that are infeasible.

        Finally, if warnings are raised during the optimization procedure, the
        following field is also returned:

            warnings : list
                A list of the warnings raised during the optimization procedure.

        A description of the termination statuses is given below.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to solve a simple optimization problem using
    `lincoa`. In practice, the  problem considered below should be solved with a
    derivative-based method as it is a smooth problem for which the derivatives
    are known. We solve it here using `lincoa` only as an illustration.

    We consider the 2-dimensional problem

    .. math::

        \min_{x, y \in \R} \quad x^2 + y^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \left\{
        \begin{array}{l}
            0 \le x \le 2,\\
            1 / 2 \le y \le 3,\\
            0 \le x + y \le 1.
        \end{array} \right.

    We solve this problem using `lincoa` starting from the initial guess
    :math:`(x_0, y_0) = (0, 1)` with at most 200 function evaluations.

        import numpy as np
