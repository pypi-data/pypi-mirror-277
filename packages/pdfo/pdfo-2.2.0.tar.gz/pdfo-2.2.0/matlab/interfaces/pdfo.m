function [x, fx, exitflag, output] = pdfo(varargin)
%PDFO is a package for solving the following generic continuous
%   optimization problem without using derivatives:
%
%   minimize    fun(x)
%       s.t.    Aineq * x <= bineq,
%               Aeq * x = beq,
%               lb <= x <= ub,
%               cineq(x) <= 0,
%               ceq(x) = 0.
%
%   In the backend, PDFO calls the late Professor M.J.D. Powell's Fortran code
%   UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA, and COBYLA.
%
%   The interface of PDFO is the same as that of function FMINCON included
%   in the Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB. So PDFO can be called in the same
%   way as calling FMINCON. In addition, PDFO can be called in some more
%   flexible ways that are not allowed by FMINCON.
%
%   1. Basic syntax
%
%   The same as FMINCON, the command
%
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, lb, ub, nonlcon)
%
%   solves the problem formulated above, where
%
%   *** fun is the name or function handle of the objective function; if
%       there is no objective function (i.e., we have a feasibility problem),
%       then set fun = []
%   *** x0 is the starting point; x0 CANNOT be []
%   *** Aineq and bineq are the coefficient matrix and right-hand side of
%       the linear inequality constraint Aineq * x <= bineq; if there is
%       no such constraint, set Aineq = [], bineq = []
%   *** Aeq and beq are the coefficient matrix and right-hand side of the
%       linear equality constraint Aeq * x = beq; if there is no such
%       constraint, set Aeq = [], beq = []
%   *** lb and ub, which are vectors of the same length as x, are the
%       lower and upper bound in the bound constraint lb <= x <= ub;
%       set lb = [] if no lower bound, and ub = [] if no upper bound
%   *** nonlcon is a function that has 1 input x and 2 outputs [cineq, ceq];
%       it calculates cineq(x) and ceq(x) for any given x; if the first
%       output of nonlcon is [], then there is no inequality constraint
%       cineq(x) <= 0; if the second output of nonlcon is [], then there
%       is no equality constraint ceq(x) = 0. If there is no nonlinear
%       constraint, set nonlcon = []
%
%   The function can also be called with more outputs, e.g.,
%
%   [x, fx, exitflag, output] = pdfo(INPUTS)
%
%   See "3. Outputs" below for explanations on these outputs.
%
%   2. Flexible syntax
%
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0) solves
%       minimize fun(x)
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, Aeq * x = beq
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, lb) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, Aeq * x = beq, lb <= x
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, lb, ub) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, Aeq * x = beq, lb <=x<= ub
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, nonlcon) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. cineq(x) <= 0, ceq(x) = 0
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, nonlcon) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, cineq(x) <= 0, ceq(x) = 0
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, nonlcon) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, Aeq * x = beq, cineq(x) <= 0, ceq(x) = 0
%   x = pdfo(fun, x0, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, lb, nonlcon) solves
%       minimize fun(x) s.t. Aineq * x <= bineq, Aeq * x = beq, lb <= x, cineq(x) <= 0, ceq(x) = 0
%
%   information = pdfo(request) returns information about the package
%       according to the information-requesting string "request", which can
%       be 'about', 'author', 'email', 'url', 'maintainer', 'credits',
%       'copyright', 'license', 'version', 'date', 'status', 'message',
%       or 'information'.
%
%   3. Outputs
%
%   *** x is the approximate solution to the optimization problem
%   *** fx is fun(x)
%   *** exitflag is an integer indicating why PDFO or its backend solver
%       returns; the possible values are
%       0: the lower bound for the trust region radius is reached
%       1: the target function value is achieved
%       2: a trust region step failed to reduce the quadratic model
%       3: the objective function has been evaluated maxfun times
%       4, 7, 8, 9: rounding errors become severe in the Fortran code
%       13: all variables are fixed by the constraints
%       14: a linear feasibility problem received and solved
%       15: a linear feasibility problem received but not solved
%       -1: NaN occurs in x
%       -2: the objective/constraint function returns NaN or nearly
%       infinite values (only in the classical mode)
%       -3: NaN occurs in the models
%       -4: constraints are infeasible
%       exitflag = 5, 10, 11, 12 are possible exitflags of the Fortran
%       code but cannot be returned by PDFO or its solvers
%   *** output is a structure with the following fields:
%       funcCount: number of function evaluations
%       nlcineq: cineq(x) (if there is nonlcon)
%       nlceq: ceq(x) (if there is nonlcon)
%       constrviolation: constrviolation of x (if problem is constrained)
%       fhist: history of function values
%       chist: history of constraint violations
%       solver: backend solver that does the computation
%       message: return message
%       warnings: a cell array that record all the warnings raised
%       during the computation
%
%   4. Options
%
%   The same as FMINCON, PDFO accepts options passed by a structure.
%   Such a structure should be passed as an additional input appended to
%   the end of the input list in the basic syntax or the flexible syntax.
%
%   The options include
%   *** maxfun: maximal number of function evaluations; default: 500*length(x0)
%   *** ftarget: target function value; default: -Inf
%   *** radius_init: initial trust region radius; typically, radius_init should be in
%       the order of one tenth of the greatest expected change to a variable;
%       radius_init should be positive; default: 1 if the problem is not scaled
%       (but min(1, min(ub-lb)/4) if the solver is BOBYQA), 0.5 if the problem
%       is scaled
%   *** radius_final: final trust region radius; radius_final reflects the precision
%       of the approximate solution obtained by PDFO; radius_final should be
%       positive and not larger than radius_init; default: 1e-6
%   *** npt: (only for NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA) number of interpolation
%       points for constructing a model; default: 2*length(x0)+1
%   *** solver: a string indicating which solver to use; possible values are:
%       'uobyqa', 'newuoa' (for unconstrained problems),
%       'bobyqa' (for bound-constrained or unconstrained problems),
%       'lincoa' (for linearly-constrained or bound-constrained or
%       unconstrained problems),
%       'cobyla' (for general constrained or unconstrained problems)
%       By default, 'uobyqa' is selected if the problem is unconstrained with 2 <= n <= 8,
%       'newuoa' is selected if the problem is unconstrained with n = 1 or n >= 9,
%       'bobyqa' is selected if the problem is bound-constrained, 'lincoa' is selected if
%       the problem is linearly constrained, and 'cobyla' is selected otherwise.
%   *** classical: a boolean value indicating whether to call the classical
%       Powell code or not; default: false
%   *** scale: (only for BOBYQA, LINCOA, and COBYLA) a boolean value
%       indicating whether to scale the problem according to bounds or not;
%       default: false; if the problem is to be scaled, then radius_init and radius_final
%       mentioned above will be used as the initial and final trust region
%       radii for the scaled problem
%   *** honour_x0: (only for BOBYQA) a boolean value indicating whether to
%       respect the user-defined x0; default: false
%   *** quiet: a boolean value indicating whether to keep quiet or not;
%       default: true (if it is false, PDFO will print the return message of the
%       Fortran code)
%   *** debug: a boolean value indicating whether to debug or not; default: false
%   *** chkfunval: a boolean value indicating whether to verify the returned
%       function and constraint (if applicable) values or not; default: false
%       (if it is true, PDFO will check whether the returned values of fun and
%       nonlcon match fun(x) and nonlcon(x), which costs a function/constraint
%       evaluation; designed only for debugging)
%
%   For example, the following code
%
%   options = struct();
%   options.maxfun = 50;
%   x = pdfo(@cos, -1, 2, 3, options);
%
%   solves
%       min cos(x) s.t. 2 * x <= 3
%   starting from x0=-1 with at most 50 function evaluations.
%
%   5. Problem defined by a structure
%
%   The same as FMINCON, a problem can be passed to PDFO by a structure
%   PROBLEM containing the following fields:
%   PROBLEM.objective, PROBLEM.x0, PROBLEM.Aineq, PROBLEM.bineq,
%   PROBLEM.Aeq, PROBLEM.beq, PROBLEM.lb, PROBLEM.ub, PROBLEM.nonlcon,
%   PROBLEM.options, where PROBLEM.objective is the function name or
%   function handle of the objective function (corresponding to the input
%   'fun' mentioned above), and all the other fields correspond to the
%   inputs introduced above with the same names. The backend solver can
%   be indicated by either PROBLEM.solver or PROBLEM.options.solver; if
%   both fields are defined, then PROBLEM.solver will be followed.
%
%   For example, the following code
%
%   problem = struct();
%   problem.objective = @cos;
%   problem.x0 = -1;
%   problem.Aineq = 2;
%   problem.bineq = 3;
%   problem.options.maxfun = 50;
%   x = pdfo(problem);
%
%   solves
%       min cos(x) s.t. 2 * x <= 3
%   starting from x0=-1 with at most 50 function evaluations.
%
%   See also UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, LINCOA, COBYLA.

% Attribute: public (can  be called directly by users)
%
% Remarks
%
% 1. Public function v.s. private function
% 1.1. Public functions are functions that can be directly called by users.
% They should be either pdfo or a solver.
% 1.2. Private functions are functions that are not supposed to be called
% by users. They are the preprocessing/postprocessing functions and
% auxiliary functions.
%
% 1. Errors that may be generated by pdfo
%
% 1.1. Normal error v.s. unexpected error
% A. Normal errors are usually caused by incorrect inputs.
% B. Unexpected errors usually imply bugs in the code. Such errors are
% displayed with 'UNEXPECTED ERROR:', except those generated by mex files.
%
% 2.1. Public errors v.s. private errors
% A. Public errors are designed to be shown to users. The identifier
% of an public error starts with 'PUB_FUN:', where PUB_FUN is a
% public function, i.e., the function that is being called by the user
% (should be either pdfo or a solver). Thanks to the error-handling
% code in public functions, public errors are displayed in a 'friendly'
% manner as follows:
%
% Error using PUB_FUN (line XXX)
% error message
%
% where the error message is a string starts with 'PUB_FUN:'. If the
% error is not generated in the file of PUB_FUN, then an additional line
% as follows is displayed:
%
% (error generated in FILE, line YYY)
%
% From the user's view point, a public error is an error raised by the
% function that he/she is calling. Therefore, if the user calls pdfo,
% then PUB_FUN should be pdfo; if the user calls a solver directly, then
% PUB_FUN should be the solver.
%
% B. Private errors are not expected to be seen by users unless there
% is a bug. All private errors are unexpected errors (but not vice versa).
% The identifier of a private error starts with 'PRI_FUN:', where PRI_FUN
% represents a private function. Private errors are displayed in the
% default manner, showing the detailed call stack trace, which is not so
% friendly but easy to debug.
%
% C. Private functions display errors as is. Public functions catch
% the exceptions thrown by private functions and display public/private
% errors properly.
%
% 2. Warnings that may be raised by pdfo
% 2.1. All the  warnings are considered to be public, i.e., they are
% designed to be shown to the users.
% 2.2. Warnings are displayed without the call stack trace.
%
% 3. probinfo
% !!! TREAT probinfo AS A READONLY VARIABLE AFTER PREPDFO !!!
% !!! DO NOT CHANGE probinfo AFTER PREPDFO !!!
%
% TODO:
% 1. Implicit NONE and variable declaration in the Fortran code
% 2. Change the interface of prepdfo to
%    probinfo = prepdfo(argin{:}, interface_type),
%    where interface_type is one of 'unconstrained',
%    'bound-constrained', 'linearly-constrained',
%    'nonlinearly-constrained'.
%    All the information needed by the solvers should be included in probinfo.
% 3. To add a new solver, we only need to call prepdfo, call the solver
%    using the information in probinfo, record the results in output, and
%    then call postpdfo.
