# pyMuParser
This is a Python binding for MuParser (https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser).
It is based on the project by Robin Gohmert (https://github.com/Ayuto/Py-MuParser), adapted for the modern MuParser project, and with additional helper classes.

Examples for scalar and vector expressions are given in the examples directory.
