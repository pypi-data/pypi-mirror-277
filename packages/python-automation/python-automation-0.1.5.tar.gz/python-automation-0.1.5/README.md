# pyautomation

pyautomation is a set of Python modules designed to automate the Microsoft Windows GUI, specifically without interacting with the mouse cursor and keyboard. At its simplest, it allows you to post mouse and keyboard events to Windows dialogs and controls.

With the pyautomation package, you can control your GUI automatically while simultaneously controlling the mouse and keyboard physically, similar to how selenium automates web browsers.
