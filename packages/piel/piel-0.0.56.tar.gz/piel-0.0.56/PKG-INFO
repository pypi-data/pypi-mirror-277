Microservices to codesign photonics, electronics, communications,
quantum, and more.

## Target functionality

- Co-simulation and optimisation between integrated photonic and
    electronic chip design.
- System interconnection modelling in multiple domains.
- Chip and interposer design integration.
- Co-design components to circuits flow.
- Maintain a multi-tool dependency design environment.

`piel` aims to provide an integrated workflow to co-design photonics and
electronics, classically and quantum. It does not aim to replace the
individual functionality of each design tool, but rather provide a glue
to easily connect them all together and extract the system performance.

## Examples

Follow the many [examples in the
documentation](https://piel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

## Microservices Toolset

This package provides interconnection functions to easily co-design
microelectronics through the functionality of the major python-integrated microelectronics projects and
photonics via the [GDSFactory project](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory).

Some existing microservice dependency integrations are:

- [amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth) - A modern hardware definition language and toolchain based on Python.
- [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) - a coroutine based
    cosimulation library for writing VHDL and Verilog testbenches in
    Python.
- [hdl21](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21) - Analog Hardware
    Description Library in Python
- [GDSFactory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory) - An open
    source platform for end to-end photonic chip design and validation
- [OpenLane v1](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) - an
    automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including
    OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen and custom methodology scripts for
    design exploration and optimization
- [Openlane v2](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2) - The next generation of OpenLane, rewritten from scratch in Python with a modular architecture
- [sax](https://github.com/flaport/sax) - S-parameter based frequency
    domain circuit simulations and optimizations using JAX.
- [thewalrus](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus) -A library for
    the calculation of hafnians, Hermite polynomials and Gaussian boson
    sampling.
- [qutip](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) - QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in
    Python

`piel` also provides a common dependency-resolved environment for all these tools, so that you just get started with designing rather than manage dependencies (which is a massive pain). Full flow environment toolsets can use `nix`, `docker`, and `local` installations following the existing open-source design flows.

## Contribution

If you feel dedicated enough to become a project maintainer, or just
want to do a single contribution, let\'s do this together!
