# file is found automatically, these supplementary library files are not.
#
# So, when we are frozen, we manually set the location of these library files so openbabel will work.
# If we are not frozen we do not do this as we expect openbabel to be correctly configured.
# The sys attribute 'frozen' is our flag, '_MEIPASS' is the dir location.
