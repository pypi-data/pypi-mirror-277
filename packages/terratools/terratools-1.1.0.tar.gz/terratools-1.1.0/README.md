## Citing TerraTools
We are currently have a JOSS Paper in review, watch [this space](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/6488#issuecomment-1997933700).

## Installation

### Pre-installation

Before installing TerraTools, first install and/or upgrade your version of pip:
```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
If you want to use the map plotting functions (such as `TerraModel.plot_layer`), make sure you have a working installation of [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html), as installation of Cartopy using pip requires [additional dependencies are met first](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html). On Mac machines, you may find that after you follow the instructions on that site, you still need to add the following command to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent:
```
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/geos/lib/
```

### Installing the latest released version

To install the latest released version of TerraTools, please use:
```
python -m pip install terratools
```

### Installing the development version

You can also install the latest development version of TerraTools from source. To do this, first clone the repository onto your local machine using git:
```
git clone git@github.com:mantle-convection-constrained/terratools.git
```
Then navigate to the top level directory and install in development mode:
```
cd terratools; python -m pip install -ve .
```

### Post-installation

Finally, check you have a fully working installation:
```
python -c "import terratools"
```
