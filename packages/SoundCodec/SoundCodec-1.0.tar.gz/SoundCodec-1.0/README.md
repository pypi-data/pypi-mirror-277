## Introduction

Codec-SUPERB sets a new benchmark in evaluating sound codec models, providing a rigorous and transparent framework for
assessing performance across a range of speech processing tasks. Our goal is to foster innovation and set new standards
in audio quality and processing efficiency.

## Key Features

### Out-of-the-Box Codec Interface

Codec-SUPERB offers an intuitive, out-of-the-box codec interface that allows for easy integration and testing of various
codec models, facilitating quick iterations and experiments.

### Multi-Perspective Leaderboard

Codec-SUPERB's unique blend of multi-perspective evaluation and an online leaderboard drives innovation in sound codec
research by providing a comprehensive assessment and fostering competitive transparency among developers.

### Standardized Environment

We ensure a standardized testing environment to guarantee fair and consistent comparison across all models. This
uniformity brings reliability to benchmark results, making them universally interpretable.

### Unified Datasets

We provide a collection of unified datasets, curated to test a wide range of speech processing scenarios. This ensures
that models are evaluated under diverse conditions, reflecting real-world applications.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voidful/Codec-SUPERB.git
cd Codec-SUPERB
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### [Leaderboard](https://codecsuperb.com)

### Out of the Box Codec Interface

```python
from SoundCodec import codec
import torchaudio

# get all available codec
print(codec.list_codec())
# load codec by name, use encodec as example
encodec_24k_6bps = codec.load_codec('encodec_24k_6bps')

# load audio
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load('sample audio')
resampled_waveform = waveform.numpy()[-1]
data_item = {'audio': {'array': resampled_waveform,
                       'sampling_rate': sample_rate}}

# extract unit
sound_unit = encodec_24k_6bps.extract_unit(data_item).unit

# sound synthesis
decoded_waveform = encodec_24k_6bps.synth(sound_unit, local_save=False)['audio']['array']
```
