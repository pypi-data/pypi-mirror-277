This small package is used to distribute a few classes and utilities used to build and consume plugins for the [Pinecone Python SDK](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-python-client).

At present this package is experimental and intended for internal use by Pinecone engineers iterating on new features. It should not be used by end-users or partners.
