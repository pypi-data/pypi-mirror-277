# Experiment Kit ðŸ§ª

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/v0.1.19-blue)

Framework for creating and maintaining projects for study and research purposes.

Creating a study project is always exciting at first, but almost immediately it can become tedious because of a whole series of arrangements that need to be made in order to experiment without worrying later.
For example, it is very easy to end up with [*spaghetti-code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code#:~:text=Spaghetti%20code%20is%20a%20pejorative,with%20insufficient%20ability%20or%20experience.) and messy directories, where you don't understand where the data are and what the results of an experiment were.

This framework aims to assist the user during this boring stages in order to let them time to focus on more valuable things.
