NAME
       feedwarrior - Feeds, warrior style

DESCRIPTION
       Inspired by ⟨https//taskwarrior.org⟩, this project seeks to simplify the creation and maintenance of engineering work logs.

       Entries of each individual log has core text content. Additionally, every entry may have any number of file attachments associated with it.

SYNOPSIS
       feedwarrior add [ -c config_file] [ -z ] [ --task-id ] [ --task-uuid ] < -s subject >

       feedwarrior attach [ -c config_file] [ -z ] < -e entry > file

       feedwarrior create [ -c config_file] [ --alias name ]

       feedwarrior entry [ -c config_file] [ -z ] [ --task-id ] [ --task-uuid ] < -s subject > < path_to_content >

       feedwarrior list [ -c config_file]

       feedwarrior show [ -c config_file] < -l feed_id >

   Common options
       -llog_id
              Log id to operate on. May be the full uuid or the alias defined at creation time.

       -cconfig_file
              Load configuration from file.

   Options for show
       --headers
              Include multipart-headers in output.

   Options for attach
       -eentry_id
              uuid of entry to attach file to.

   Options for create
       --aliasalias_id
              Create log id alias that may be used as argument to -l for future operations.

   Options for add and entry
       -ssubject
              Entry subject.

       --task-idid
              Associate the log entry with the given taskwarrior numeric id. This is a quasi-magical instruction which will resolve to the actual taskwarrior uuid.

       --task-uuiduuid
              Associate the log entry with the given taskwarrior numeric uuid.

ATTACHMENTS
       Both feedwarrior add and feedwarrior entry will return the created entry id.

       This id can be used further with the -e flag for attachments.

       Any file in any format may be an attachment. The feedwarrior tool imposes little if no restriction on what data qualifies as valid attachment data.

INTERACTIVE ENTRIES
       The feedwarrior add command enables interactive definition of textual update entry contents.

       It will open an editor (at the moment hardcoded to vim) to receive the contents.

DATA STORE
       Log entries are stored as email-like MIME Multipart messages, wrapped in a json metadata structure.

       Only the default, simple filesystem structure is currently available as storage backend.

EXAMPLE
       # create feed
       feedwarrior create --alias myfeed

       ¤ add log entry
       ENTRY=`feedwarrior -l myfeed entry -s "first update" /path/to/contents.txt

       # attach file to entry
       feedwarrior attach -e $ENTRY <attachment_file>

       ¤ interactively add log entry contents
       entry=`feedwarrior -l myfeed add -s "second update"

       # show current state of feed (chronologically)
       feedwarrior -l myfeed show
