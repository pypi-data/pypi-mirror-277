## Unreleased

N/A

## [0.3.0] 03-06-2024

### Changed

- [Breaking change] Parameter settings for `additional_modules/feature_filtering` were changed from a list of ranges to a dictionary with explicit values.
- Reworked score assignment for qualitative phenotype data: phenotype-associated features now always receive a score of 1.0, and non-associated ones a score of 0.0.
- For all modules with runtime restriction, the 'maximum_runtime' parameter was set to a default of '0' (unlimited runtime). Therefore, runtime restriction must now be specified explicitly.
- Added a 'module_passed' parameter to all modules. This allows a more accurate description via the SummaryWriter (e.g. module was activated but timed out, and lack of e.g. annotation is due to premature ending and not because there were no hits).

## [0.2.2] 27-05-2024

### Changed

- Removed 'phenotypes' as separate Feature attribute: write to Annotation object instead.
- Implemented sorting of annotation entries in descending order

## [0.2.1] 26-05-2024

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in "SummaryWriter": implemented error catching.

## [0.2.0] 26-05-2024

### Changed

- Replaced global logger with logger specific for `main_cli()`. `main()` now needs an argument `logger`
- Reworked output file naming: all output files now start with `out.fermo.` and a suffix specifying their type
- Removed output directory selection: the output directory is now always `results` located in the directory in which the peaktable resides.
- Features now always have default result values (previously, some Features could have an empty dictionary)
- MS2Query assignment now uses temporary directories for data reading/writing

### Fixed

- Removed `sys.exit(0)` in case of successful run to fix compatibility issue with Celery task manager (`fermo_gui`)

## [0.1.1] 24-05-2024

### Changed

- Implemented logging verboseness parameter for CLI interface

## [0.1.0] 19-05-2024

- First public release of `fermo_core`
