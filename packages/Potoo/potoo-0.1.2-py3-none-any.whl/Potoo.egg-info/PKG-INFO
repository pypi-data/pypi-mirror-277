# Topoo

A [textual](https://textual.textualize.io) based application to present your
markdown-based slides inside the terminal. Great

### What's up with the name?

Since the textual project, apparently, started naming their textual based
applications after bird species I searched for one with large eyes, since you
usually need to zoom in on your terminal to get to a usable font size **and**
whose name wasn't already taken on PyPI. _Potoo_ seemed perfect since, according
to Wikipedia, they "are a group of birds related to the nightjars and
_frogmouths_" and guess what the
[textual based markdown viewer](https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth) is
called.
