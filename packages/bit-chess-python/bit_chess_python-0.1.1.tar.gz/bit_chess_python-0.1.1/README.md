## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project implements Chess bitboards using NumPy 64-bit integers and various NumPy array functions for rotated bitboard implementation. This process is used to store all possible orthogonal and diagonal moves, and their respective blocker formations calculated as a unique index. A legal move generator is created by keeping track of pinned pieces and other game conditions to reduce the need for recalculating opposing attacks.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing
